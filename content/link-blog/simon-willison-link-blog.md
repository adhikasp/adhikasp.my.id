Simon Willison shares his thoughts on maintaining a link blog - a curated collection of interesting links with personal commentary. What resonates with me is how link blogs serve dual purposes: they're both a personal knowledge management tool and a way to share discoveries with others.

Key points from Simon's article that I find compelling:
- Link blogs help build a personal archive of interesting content
- They encourage active engagement with content through commentary
- The practice combines personal note-taking with public sharing
- It's a lightweight form of blogging that's easier to maintain than full articles

This aligns perfectly with my goal of both keeping personal notes and sharing interesting findings with others. A link blog can serve as a bridge between private note-taking and public sharing, making it easier to contribute to the broader conversation while building a personal knowledge base.
