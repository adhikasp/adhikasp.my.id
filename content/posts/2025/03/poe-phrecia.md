### 3. **Successful Starter Builds**

- **Flicker Strike Wildspeaker**: Players found it to be a strong choice for fast mapping, with good survivability when built correctly.
- **Cobra Lash Surfcaster**: This build has been highlighted for its fun playstyle and effectiveness in clearing content, especially when combined with the right gear.

### 4. **Player Experiences**
- Many players shared their experiences with various builds, emphasizing the importance of gearing and the impact of specific ascendancies on performance.
- Players transitioning from one build to another often found success by switching to builds that required less investment or had more straightforward mechanics.

### 5. **Recommendations for New Players**
- **Avoid Complex Builds**: New players are advised to steer clear of builds that require extensive knowledge of mechanics or high investment to be effective.
- **Focus on Simplicity**: Builds that offer straightforward gameplay and good scaling with minimal investment (like Power Siphon Mines or Volcanic Fissure) are recommended for a smoother experience.

### Conclusion
Overall, the discussions highlight a mix of successful builds and cautionary tales about the pitfalls of more complex or high-investment builds. Players are encouraged to choose builds that align with their playstyle and investment capacity, especially in the early stages of the league

### 2. **General Feedback on Builds**
