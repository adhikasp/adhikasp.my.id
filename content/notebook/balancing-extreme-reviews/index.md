description: "Imagine you're trying to figure out the best product to buy, the best hotel to book, or even the best teacher to take a class from, based on ratings. Often, these ratings get averaged together. However, what if some people don't leave a rating, especially if they have strong opinions? This can skew the average and give a misleading impression."
