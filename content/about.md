Hey, I'm Adhika. I'm a software engineer driven by a passion for solving real-world problems by shipping products that users love. I enjoy building tech solution and applied AI products.

Currently, I'm a Lead Software Engineer at Grab, where I create services that help millions of merchants across Southeast Asia grow their businesses. One of the most exciting projects I've co-owned is the [GrabMerchant Assistant](https://www.grab.com/sg/inside-grab/stories/grabx-ai-merchant-assistant/), an LLM-powered virtual advisor. I led the backend development, prompt engineering, and evaluation to bring it to life.

I'm also deeply involved in promoting the adoption of Generative AI within the engineering community. I've worked on building developer tools, agentic bots, and influencing our company's broader AI strategy.

Before this, I was a Senior Software Engineer on the same team, where I built the merchant business insights dashboard using technologies like Go, Apache Druid, and Spark to handle massive datasets. I also developed a real-time distributed data ingestion system for financial reporting, processing a high volume of events with sub-second latency. I've always had a passion for performance and reliability, which led me to lead a major cloud migration that significantly improved performance and cut costs, all with zero downtime.

Earlier in my career at Blibli.com, I focused on developer experience. I built an API gateway to unify authentication for numerous services and optimized high-traffic, business-critical APIs using reactive design principles.

Through my experiences, I've learned to be adaptable, navigating various technologies and organizational processes to get the job done. What matters most is solving the problem at hand, and I'm not afraid to do what it takes to ship a solution.

My expertise spans across:
- **Backend Development**: Building distributed services and APIs using Go and Python.
- **Applied AI**: Working with LLMs, including prompt engineering, evaluation pipelines, and deploying AI-powered features.
- **Data Engineering**: Extensive work with data pipelines, OLAP databases, and large-scale analytics.
- **Infrastructure & SRE**: Managing cloud infrastructure on AWS and GCP, focusing on scalability, performance, and reliability using tools like Terraform and Kubernetes.

Ultimately, I enjoy working on complex technical challenges. I'm driven by a passion for building reliable systems and improving developer productivity, backed by the grit and willpower to see things through.

In my free time, I tinker with self-hosted services and Linux systems. This website is one example of my personal projects.
