Hey, I am Adhika. I work as a software engineer with experience in building and scaling distributed systems.

My expertise spans across:

- **Backend Development**: Building distributed services and APIs using Go, Python, and Java/Spring Boot. I have experience in developing high-throughput systems processing millions of transactions daily.
- **AI/ML Engineering**: Working with LLMs and recommendation systems, including prompt engineering, evaluation pipelines, and production deployment of AI-powered features.
- **Data Engineering**: Extensive work with data pipelines, OLAP databases (Apache Druid), and analytics using Presto. Experience in data modeling, ETL processes, data wrangling with lightweight analysis, and building data-driven features.
- **Infrastructure & DevOps**: Managing cloud infrastructure on AWS, focusing on scalability, monitoring, and cost optimization. Setting up CI/CD pipelines and implementing SRE best practices.
- **Developer Experience**: Building developer tooling and improving engineering productivity through automation, better testing practices, and documentation.

I enjoy working on complex technical challenges, particularly around system scalability, data processing, and AI/ML applications. I'm passionate about building reliable systems and improving developer productivity.

In my free time, I tinker with self-hosted services and Linux systems. This website is one example of my personal projects.
