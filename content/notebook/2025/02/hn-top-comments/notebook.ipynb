Long time lurker, so this is pretty cool to finally take part :)<p>I made this because I wanted the eye-strain free and minimalist qualities of my kindle&#x2F;Eink applied to so much more of what I do on a computer.<p>Lack of speed and ghosting felt like it made traditional Eink impossible to do most computing tasks. So we focused on making the most Paperlike epaper display that has no ghosting and high refresh rate - 60 to 120fps. We started working on this in 2018.<p>We developed our own custom epaper display tech we call LivePaper. We focused on solving the tradeoffs RLCDs traditionally have - around reflectance %, metallic-look &#x2F; not Paperlike enough, viewing angle, white state, rainbow mura, parallax, resolution, size, lack of quality backlight, etc.<p>First proof of concept in late 2021, and then it took us 2.5 years to get it into production.<p>And we built a whole android tablet around it.<p>It’s essentially our attempt at making a remarkable tablet on steroids &#x2F; kindle on steroids. Definitely some trade offs, but on the whole we think it’s worth it. (&amp; on twitter a bunch of early customers seem to think so too)<p>Note: it’s 60fps epaper, not off the shelf Eink. We spent years developing what we think is the best epaper display in the world and it’s exclusively manufactured by our display factory in Japan.<p>There’s still many cases where traditional Eink is going to be better (bistability, viewing angle, white state color, etc), but we feel for more general purpose computers you can code on and do google docs on and do fast multitouch amongst a thousand other things, the speed and lack of ghosting totally makes it worth it.<p>Think of it as a Godzilla sized pebble watch with a decade of improvement<p>Or think of it as a gameboy advanced, advanced</td>\n",

It feels ungrateful and cynical to keep calling new models &quot;boring&quot;.<p>The reality though is that normie needs were accomplished several generations ago. I&#x27;ll use my girlfriend as a sample of such user.<p>She can&#x27;t tell the difference between LCD and OLED nor would she notice Pro-motion.<p>You can add a million features to the camera app but she opens it and presses the shutter. Her only awareness of features is when she accidentally enables one and doesn&#x27;t know how to get back.<p>You could set her back 8 iOS versions and she probably wouldn&#x27;t notice. Because she uses none of the hundreds of features released since. Not because she dislikes them, she doesn&#x27;t know they even exist.<p>All the spectacular advances in computing power are lost on her as this makes zero difference for the Facebook cat video group and Pinterest.<p>You might assume my girlfriend is perhaps lowly educated or just not tech savvy. Wrong, she&#x27;s highly educated, even works in IT, although not in an engineering role. It&#x27;s not that she&#x27;s unable to understand the advances, she simply doesn&#x27;t care.<p>It&#x27;s becoming ever harder to justify new models for normies. Pretty much they buy the new one when the battery of their current one runs bad, typically every 3-4 years.<p>I think this is also why Apple put many Pro features into the regular model. Most people don&#x27;t buy the pro and they&#x27;re desperate for selling points in the regular model.<p>If the iPhone would have true user-swappable batteries, their business would collapse.</td>\n",

In fact, the company has very high customer satisfaction ratings, including an NPS that is in the ballpark of Amazon, and a very high customer retention rate.  More than half of the people who subscribe to the service are still subscribers after two years, which is unusually high for a subscription service.<p>I obviously cannot speak to your girlfriend&#x27;s experience.  With nearly a million subscribers, there are certainly people with bad experiences -- same is true with any service.  Netflix is great but I am sure there are a number of people who have had a bad experience.<p>I would encourage the HackerNews community to consider the opposite:  if we assume the investors in this business do perform due diligence, is there another possible explanation?  Is it possible that this case is not representative of the average case?<p>But hey, we don&#x27;t have to be he-said-she-said here, anyone can just go to the site and verify if this claim is true.  In essence, the claim is:  &quot;The site tricked me.  I went to buy a single pair of shoes, and in doing so, they actually started taxing my credit card every month, and no one warned me.&quot;<p>Folks are right to be skeptical -- a lot of businesses have done this, tried to hide the fact there would be future charges.  Does JustFab?<p>I just went to the site -- you can do this -- picked a random pair of boots and put them in my shopping cart.  I then clicked checkout, and here is what that page looked like:<p><a href=\"http://imagesup.net/?di=15138026329215\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;imagesup.net&#x2F;?di=15138026329215</a><p>&quot;I wonder how much of this $100 million are from people like my girlfriend who simply didn&#x27;t read their entire 2,500 words Terms of Service and were unaware that they were charged $39.95 a month for nothing&quot;  -- Seriously, please look at the link above to the checkout flow and tell me that&#x27;s how you see it, that you have to read the 2,500 word TOS to figure out that this is the case.<p>Seems pretty clear to me.  You can get the boots for $39 if you join the VIP program.  &quot;With this purchase, you will be activating your VIP membership&quot;<p>Under &quot;How VIP Membership Works&quot;, it explains:\\n&quot; If you do not take action between the 1st and the 5th of the month, you will be charged $39.95 for a member credit on the 6th. Each credit can be redeemed for 1 JustFab item, so use it to shop later!&quot;<p>It&#x27;s in plain English, and in the same font size as everything else on the page.  Over 800,000 people can manage their subscription account every month without racking up credits.  I&#x27;m sorry it didn&#x27;t work for your girlfriend, and I recognize she is not the only one who has not grokked the subscription element and been surprised -- but it&#x27;s a tiny minority, and the information is quite clear on the site.<p>Finally, one may ask: why subscription at all?  Well, $39 for a high quality pair of boots is a really, really good deal.  Most e-commerce merchants have to reacquire their customers for every transaction.  By asking members to commit to come back to the site once a month, the company doesn&#x27;t have to constantly pay google or other traffic sources to acquire members, and to have prices like this you have to keep costs low.  That&#x27;s the deal.  There are plenty of higher priced places to buy shoes if you don&#x27;t want to subscribe.<p>Double finally: credits never expire.  If you have 8 credits in your account, you can go get 8 pairs of shoes.<p>Justfab is an awesome company and is creating and H&amp;M or Zara experience online: fast fashion at great prices.  I&#x27;m not sure HN is the target demographic, but it&#x27;s a great service and customers love it, and VCs have poured money into because of that.</td>\n",

While more building would help, a lack of it isn&#x27;t the main cause of this problem.<p>Ask yourself, do Canada, Australia, New Zealand, the US, Britain, Ireland, etc, all have the same inability to build or is there maybe some other common cause?<p>In my view this is symptomatic of a more fundamental issue - global asset price inflation driven by a broken financial system (i.e. a system being artificially pumped up with cheap credit). Housing is just where the rubber hits the road and regular lives are directly effected. Just look at the tight correlation between the increase in the money supply and property prices.<p>For those who insist that the number of properties is inadequate, take a look at the numbers for each of the countries I mentioned in the first chart here: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.oecd.org&#x2F;els&#x2F;family&#x2F;HM1-1-Housing-stock-and-construction.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.oecd.org&#x2F;els&#x2F;family&#x2F;HM1-1-Housing-stock-and-cons...</a> (Total number of dwellings per thousand inhabitants, 2022 and 2011).<p>This is a problem of underutilisation in my view. Too many properties are being used as investments and not as a primary residence.<p>Cheap credit causes an increase in demand. This is not demand for homes but additional &#x27;artificial&#x27; demand for properties as investments. Think short term rentals, second homes, land banked properties, etc. By definition, only investment properties can be underutilised - owner occupied homes are occupied! So in an environment that encourages property investment you will see more underutilisation.<p>What will cause prices to fall is higher interest rates. This is what has been happening in NZ.</td>\n",

The transaction time is about ~5 seconds and there are no fees, so it&#x27;s almost on par with a credit card, except you don&#x27;t depend on a bank or a credit card company.<p>Also, check out this link to google trends: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;trends.google.com&#x2F;trends&#x2F;explore?q=raiblocks\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;trends.google.com&#x2F;trends&#x2F;explore?q=raiblocks</a>. You&#x27;ll see that the country with the most interest in raiblocks is Venezuela, which coincidentally is going through hyperinflation. Bitcoins used to be quite big there as a way of avoiding the loss in value of the national currency, but as the country became poorer and the cryptocurrency networks more congested, the fees became prohibitively expensive. Raiblocks could be a good alternative to cash, or at least help some of the most technically savvy people.<p>What I&#x27;m aiming at is, give the technology a chance. As the top poster says, it might be a big bubble, but it might also be a revolutionary technology (or both, just like the internet).<p>EDIT: Sorry folks I have to go so you&#x27;ll have to wait until I check my account again.

When a good community grows, it becomes worse in two ways: (a) more recent arrivals don't have as much of whatever quality distinguished the original members, and (b) the large size of the group makes people behave worse, because there is more anonymity in a larger group.<p>I've spent many hours over the past several years trying to understand and mitigate such problems.  I've come up with a bunch of tweaks that worked, and I have hopes I'll be able to come up with more.<p>The idea I'm currently investigating, in case anyone is curious, is that votes rather than comments may be the easiest place to attack this problem.  Although snarky comments themselves are the most obvious symptom, I suspect that voting is on average dumber than commenting, because it requires so much less work.  So I'm going to try to see if it's possible to identify people who consistently upvote nasty comments and if so count their votes less.</td>\n",

However, I can say that for Namecheap, this is not something we would ever even consider doing.<p>In my experience though, lookups are more complex than most think. We are querying so many different sources to give you availability status, some of which are less reliable than others. For example, with smaller TLDs like .ai or .is, lookups may be less reliable than a well-oiled machine like Verisign, which operates the .com and .net TLDs, among others. As a result, sometimes with a less reliable registry, there can be false positives, resulting in the registrar showing a domain as &quot;available&quot; when it is actually registered.<p>In addition to registry connection reliability, there are also many different aftermarket sources that registrars often pull from. You know when you see a Premium domain (registered and usually higher priced) in search? That could be coming from any number of 3rd party aftermarket platforms, which also can have varying reliability and&#x2F;or stale listings.<p>Lastly, you have to consider that some registrars handle the &quot;drop window&quot; differently than others. If a domain deletes and is removed from the zone, ergo, becoming available again, some registrars have a buffer period before they show it as available again.<p>It does not appear that Felons.io had ever been registered before, which makes this case pretty strange.</td>\n",

Here are a few:<p>Firstly, Gmail&#x27;s success is entirely predicated on the health of the global email ecosystem. Gmail does not, inherently, have any network effects (unlike FB, messengers, any other comms tool of Gmail&#x27;s scale). Email itself, of course has a huge network effect, and <i>that</i> is because you can email anyone in the world, regardless of what email system they use. It&#x27;s because email is open. If we lose an open, healthy ecosystem with many providers, we&#x27;ll destroy the base we stand on.<p>Secondly, we care deeply about having positive relationships with developers and all our users. I can tell you it definitely makes me sad to see articles like this. There are going to be false positives, we will make mistakes, but we certainly care a lot about fixing issues like this when we hear about them.<p>I agree Postmaster tools has been underinvested in and we could do much better there.</td>\n",

For years I have been working on product interfaces (not just apps). Many studies I conducted actually told me that people favored analog controls over digital touch screens controls. It gives you tactile feedback, making it accessible for anyone with sense of touch.<p>&gt; Audi, for instance has said that part of the reason it’s discontinuing its rotary controller is that a touchscreen better supports Apple CarPlay and Android Auto.<p>This to me is insane reasoning. That is no way user centric. This decision is 100% business driven and has nothing to do with the end user. It basically means they have given up on developing a good branded interface between the driver and the car.<p>&gt; phones and tablets are familiar, so too should in-vehicle touchscreens.<p>This too is so weird to me. I get that you want users to recognize an interface. And that it should mimic how you use other things.

Here are those claims:<p>1. &quot;Super Apps&quot;<p>Apple has restrictions on what they allow on the App Store as far as &quot;Super Apps&quot;, which are apps that might offer a wide variety of different services (specifically, an app which has several &quot;mini programs&quot; within it, like apps within an app). In China, WeChat does many different things, for example, from messaging to payments. This complaint alleges that Apple makes it difficult or impossible to offer this kind of app on their platform. Apple itself offers a &quot;super app&quot; of course, which is the Apple ecosystem of apps.<p>2. Cloud streaming apps<p>Similar to &quot;super apps&quot;, the document alleges that Apple restricts apps which might stream different apps directly to the phone (like video games). It seems there are several roadblocks that Apple has added that make these kinds of apps difficult to release and promote - and of course, Apple offers their own gaming subscription service called Apple Arcade which might be threatened by such a service.<p>3. Messaging interoperability<p>Probably most people are familiar with this already, how messages between (for example) iOS and Android devices do not share the same feature-set.<p>4. Smartwatches<p>Other smart watches than the Apple Watch exist, but the document alleges that Apple restricts the functionality that these devices have access to so that they are less useful than the Apple Watch. Also, the Apple Watch itself does not offer compatibility with Android.<p>5. Digital wallets<p>It is claimed that Apple restricts the APIs available so that only Apple Pay can implement &quot;tap to pay&quot; on iOS. In addition to lock-in, note that Apple also collects fees from banks for using Apple Pay, so they get direct financial benefit in addition to the more nebulous benefit of enhancing the Apple platform.</td>\n",

The community is also fragmented, with too many ways to do the same thing in the name of some platonic ideal of personal freedom over practicality.<p>A simple question like &quot;How do I set up Black with neovim to format my Python files on save?&quot; will yield a dozen answers, each one with someone&#x27;s favourite plugin. Setting up that plugin will require another plugin, and so on until you end up with a Jenga tower of dependencies that doesn&#x27;t quite work the way you want, but is too fragile and time-consuming to tweak correctly.<p>In the meantime, I can just Ctrl+P and install what I need in vscode and be on my way in a few minutes.<p>I don&#x27;t particularly like vscode. It&#x27;s heavy and slow and janky, particularly on older laptops. I don&#x27;t like being sucked back into the Microsoft ecosystem after spending years getting away from it.

For example, I&#x27;ve bookmarked and often share this recent HN poll where 88% of people here think there&#x27;s a negative stigma to a medium article.\\n<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=33223222\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=33223222</a><p>It&#x27;s sad and entirely our fault. We didn&#x27;t fail but we did lose our way. Here&#x27;s how I see it:<p>1. Lost our way on recommendations. When I showed up the company was convinced that engagement equals quality. That&#x27;s not true and it gets even more pronounced if you pay people to game your recommendation system. I think we were boosting articles that made people think we were a site for clickbait. The canonical example for HN is &quot;Why NodeJS is dead&quot; by a new programmer with zero experience or context. Readers noticed this, but worse, so did authors. And so we lost the incentive for a lot of the best and most interesting authors to bother because they were getting swamped by content-mill type authors. As of December, about 30% of our recommendations are generated by a new system that is picking much higher quality articles that have been vetted for substance over clickbait. This is getting a lot better, rapidly.<p>2. Got lost thinking about the creator economy, when we should have kept thinking about doers. Distribution was our winning value proposition (on top of simple free tools). We were built to find and boost individual articles and that meant that anyone with something great to say had a chance to get their story boosted, often by a lot. This is my original background in publishing: working at O&#x27;Reilly helping them publish programming books that were written by programmers. For a lot of topics, personal experience trumps everything. Not to knock creators, but by definition full time content creation gets in the way of having personal experiences that are worth writing about. We are partly through fixing this and #1.<p>Those are the two most obvious ones. But then there&#x27;s a longer list. We competed with our platform publishers by starting our own in house publications. Those are shut down now. We started but didn&#x27;t finish a number of redesigns and so the tools didn&#x27;t get better for a couple of years. We&#x27;re past that now and are putting out table stakes features again and some innovations too.<p>What I told our investors was that there was a huge pile of shit to dig out of, but that it would be worthwhile eventually. And I still believe both that there is a lot more to do and also that it&#x27;ll be worthwhile.</td>\n",

The OP is correct that we should have asked for additional repro instructions after his initial report.  Unfortunately, all he submitted was a link to the post he&#x27;d already made (on a real account whose consent he did not have - violating our ToS and responsible disclosure policy), saying that &quot;the bug allow facebook users to share links to other facebook users&quot;.  Had he included the video initially, we would have caught this much more quickly.<p>For background, as a few other commenters have pointed out, we get hundreds of reports every day. Many of our best reports come from people whose English isn&#x27;t great - though this can be challenging, it&#x27;s something we work with just fine and we have paid out over $1 million to hundreds of reporters. However, many of the reports we get are nonsense or misguided, and even those (if you enter a password then view-source, you can access the password! When you submit a password, it&#x27;s sent in the clear over HTTPS!) provide some modicum of reproduction instructions. We should have pushed back asking for more details here.<p>However, the more important issue here is with how the bug was demonstrated using the accounts of real people without their permission. Exploiting bugs to impact real users is not acceptable behavior for a white hat. We allow researchers to create test accounts here: <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/whitehat/accounts/\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.facebook.com&#x2F;whitehat&#x2F;accounts&#x2F;</a> to help facilitate responsible research and testing. In this case, the researcher used the bug he discovered to post on the timelines of multiple users without their consent.<p>As you can see at <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/whitehat\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.facebook.com&#x2F;whitehat</a>, in order to qualify for a payout you must &quot;make a good faith effort to avoid privacy violations&quot; and &quot;use a test account instead of a real account when investigating bugs. When you are unable to reproduce a bug with a test account, it is acceptable to use a real account, except for automated testing. Do not interact with other accounts without the consent of their owners.&quot;  Unfortunately, the OP did neither of those things.  We welcome and will pay out for future reports from him (and anyone else!) if they&#x27;re found and demonstrated within these guidelines.</td>\n",

Startup culture thirty years ago had a decidedly American flavor. Today, it does not because the world is big and diverse and because entrepreneurs today who do startups come from all sorts of cultures and backgrounds. Surely, those who come from such divergent backgrounds hold differing political and religious views. Some are conservative, others liberal, still others apolitical. Some are theists, others atheists. The variations are many but one thing is certain: <i>not all people think alike on political, religious, or social topics</i>. These are issues that inherently will divide.<p>What happens, then, when people attempt to set political, social, or religious tests as criteria for who can hold important positions in a business organization? Well, it gets about as ugly as it can get, just as such tests proved ugly when used historically by, say, Christians to exclude Jews from holding important positions in society or to punish atheists for not holding to some prescribed creed.<p>One might say, &quot;<i>this</i> is different&quot; because we are not holding to an arbitrary creed but rather to fundamental principles that ought to govern all humanity. Well, that is precisely how those who sought to impose thought control in other eras rationalized their conduct. &quot;Are you now or have you ever been a member of the Communist Party&quot; is a question that destroyed many careers as the blacklists proliferated back in the 1950s. That was indeed a repulsive set of events by which many innocent persons were hurt and today our national conscience wishes it could take back the damage done to them.<p>So why is this any different? It is easy enough to whip oneself up into a lather over Ms. Rice’s policies if one disagrees with them but what about the half of America (or whatever significant percentage) that does not. And why should this be relevant to board service?<p>Politics, religion, and social worldviews <i>divide</i> people and have no place as limiting tests in a business environment. Scolding and finger-wagging was bad enough coming from a first-grade teacher trying to promote sanctimonious values back in the 1950s. Do we really want a counterpart agenda now setting rules for who can be a founder, who can be an investor, who can be a director, who can be a CEO, or who can otherwise take a prominent role in the startup world? The answer should be an <i>emphatic</i> no.<p>Principle is more important here than a particular outcome. What happens with Ms. Rice is not the issue here. What matters is upholding the abiding principle (precious in a free society) that people can hold divergent views on such topics as politics, religion, and society without being punished for their views in a business context. People can and ought to be able to unite to form great companies without having to compare notes on how they voted in the last election or some similar matter having nothing whatever to do with whether someone can add value to the venture. This is central to startup culture. Let us not lose sight of something so basic.</td>\n",

Most early-stage startups use the (in 2008, when I did mine) best practice of “delete=1”.   Changing your whole database over to permanent cascade delete is only easy if you’re a very experienced programmer or who knows what he’s doing.  And that sets aside the fact  that even if you know what you’re doing technically, there are lots of business logic problems with just deleting things out of the database and anonymizing users is very tricky.<p>I was not a great programmer when I started my first startup.  I was learning as I went along.<p>We couldn’t afford a lawyer, and the amount of time for me (the only programmer) to go through and read all the regulations and make all the requisite changes in the product I would estimate might take on the order of a month or two, which if timed poorly would’ve killed our company.   I say again: at an early stage startup with one programmer, you cannot have that one programmer spending two months on compliance.<p>It’s just gotten to the point that there’s one comment after another responding to this regulation or that regulation or this situation or whatever with “well, just call HR“, or “I can’t believe you don’t have a company policy for that!”<p>Or “well just ask your lawyers“.  It ain’t that easy.  Do you have any idea how much it would cost to have “your lawyers” go through the GDPR, tell you what you need to do, and deal with all of the edge cases and gray areas? $20k or $30k doesn’t seem too high.<p>My biggest fear is that all of these complex bureaucratic laws are just raising the bar for doing a startup.  Maybe the days of two people doing a startup in someone’s garage should be in the past?

Moderate people are repulsed by such forums and the quantity of hate-speech they generate, which further compounds the negative feedback loop.<p>Unchecked extremism compounded by more unchecked extremism inevitably leads to scenarios like the ones we’re witnessing more and more often.</td>\n",

But it wasn&#x27;t even AI. Instead he made this prediction because he saw the rise of no-code tools replacing software developers because managers could finally cut out the pesky &quot;translators&quot;, i.e. software developers.<p>I said it then and I will say it now. If your managers could specify what they need in a manner that no-code tools, or now AI, can generate the code they want, they will have to be extremely exact in their language. So exact in fact that they will need to specify a program in a click and drag interface, or in human language.<p>Since they hire software developers to make the specification more rigid, and the managers don&#x27;t seem to be getting better at this over time, why would you believe this skill set is going to go away?<p>In essence what has happened in software development is that the level of abstraction has gone up while the machine has taken over more and more of the nitty gritty details. From punchcards, to assembly, to COBOL, C, Perl, Java, Python, Erlang, Rust.<p>Of course I&#x27;m leaving out some languages here, but the level of abstraction has been rising.<p>But the rigidity of what is needed to specify a program that really does what you want hasn&#x27;t. Especially evidenced by the fact that recent programming language developments often have a specific area where they shine, but not raising the abstraction level that much.<p>I&#x27;d be surprised if the next step is &quot;Hi, I&#x27;m an ideas guy, please give me an app that does Uber, for bicycles, but better.&quot;</td>\n",

This is because those dollars that are printed go directly into bonds, equities, and assets that only a small amount of the population owns a significant amount of. When money is &quot;printed&quot; the Fed actually injects money into financial markets through buying assets. This asset inflation caused by money printing gives more money to the rich to buy more assets, thus driving up the prices of financial products, real estate, and all other valued assets in society. Thus, cost of living skyrockets, but only the rich are actually increasing their net worth (which is increasing exponentially). All of this happens while minimum wage, and most wages, are stagnant.<p>Wealth inequality and social unrest in America is DIRECTLY related to corrupt and&#x2F;or incompetent (you choose) Fed policies.

I&#x27;m talking completely about the company&#x27;s own interests.<p>Let&#x27;s address the first reason: malleability. A recent grad presumably will adopt the company&#x27;s culture faster, complain less, and in general pick up things sooner. Well, the hardest, meanest coworkers I&#x27;ve ever had were late twenties, early thirties. I&#x27;ve worked with people in their sixties, and they&#x27;re sweet people.

Not only was he softer (at least deep down) but he was smarter, having done it for decades. Even when he met a new problem, his keenly developed taste made him more likely to choose something that would be more maintainable long term.<p>Now let&#x27;s address the second reason: salary. I am 10 times better than I was when I started. I know, because I still work with some of my code from back then, and I desperately want to rewrite it all. How much more does a senior developer make than a new hire? 50% more? Seems worth it to me. 100% more? 200% more? Still maybe worth it. And if some old fella can&#x27;t get work at all, maybe he would settle for something between 50% and 100% more. I mean, why not at least make an offer?<p>It just don&#x27;t make no sense.

High School is nothing like the usual media portrayal - I&#x27;ve never heard anyone even talk about a party, nobody&#x27;s doing anything stronger than weed, nobody&#x27;s fucking or even dating at all.<p>Smartphone use definitely has a negative effect. I&#x27;m in some APs, some Honors, and some regular classes and the #1 difference I&#x27;ve observed between the kids in each cohort is how often they&#x27;re on their phones. The CP kids leave their phones on their desks and are making out with the damn things whenever they can, sometimes even when the teacher is trying to lecture them. The Honors kids have them under their desks and only use them when they have nothing more pressing to do. The AP kids have them on mute in their backpacks. (I leave mine in my locker, and only use it to listen to music.)<p>Most of the anxiety is over college admissions - not necessarily to the Ivy League (everyone knows that&#x27;s just luck of the draw), but the &quot;second-tier&quot; schools (Carnegie-Mellon, Rensselaer, Duke, Cornell, etc.) where over-achieving can still net you a good chance of admission. There&#x27;s a lot of focus on &quot;building your brand&quot; and trying to &quot;stand out&quot; (make your life more &quot;interesting&quot; in the narrow ways that look good on a college application). The more technically-oriented kids are balls-deep in resume-driven development; they follow the tutorial for every trendy tech buzzword possible (mostly data-science and ML stuff) so that they can blog about it on their Squarespace-generated portfolios. I&#x27;m a member of the FIRST Robotics Team and, like everyone else there, I do absolutely nothing, because the team has 5 times more people than it actually needs.

As a teenager, I noticed my mother being extremely difficult. Even more so now. My father is no walk in the park either. But I believe they have a deep rooted love from decades and went through every event and basically adult stage in life together.<p>I&#x27;m 38. I date in my age group. Which means both of us are dating people that have been sleeping with others for two decades. Each of us has been overseas with countless friends and exs. Many women have been engaged, some married, and we&#x27;ve all had our hearts broken. We&#x27;ve all gained a few lbs. My hair is starting to grey.<p>Can I find someone that enjoys being with me? Sure.<p>Can I find someone that doesn&#x27;t just say &quot;wtf am I doing here&quot; if times get tough for health or financial or just plain old age? I&#x27;m not sure.<p>I&#x27;ve heard many long time married old men say that when they look at their partner, they still see the beauty glimmering through that they saw at 19.<p>If I meet a partner at 40, when we start really getting old and annoyed, what am I going to hold on to? How lucky I am to be her 23rd partner?<p>I know this is a judgemental view, but I think it&#x27;s human nature.<p>Edit: for those that think this is just some personal issue, you should look up divorce stats by number of previous sexual partners.

Power Divide - society will be easily divided into two groups: those who depend on the UBI to live and those who don&#x27;t.  The former will be absolutely at the mercy of the latter.  We can see this a little bit with the coronavirus relief packages.<p>2. Predators - individuals and companies will find a way to take your UBI check from you as fast as possible.  We can see this in housing where some governments give poor people vouchers for rent.  Those vouchers are targeted by slumlords who find a way to give you as little as possible for them.  There will be rampant scams and bad behavior  in areas where the UBI makes up a larger portion of total income.<p>3. Charity - let&#x27;s say we actually give every person enough money for food, housing, and utilities. Some people will mess up. They could spend it all on an addiction or just make a bad investment.  Even with UBI they could still end up hungry or homeless.  Will we help them? Or will we say &quot;you had your UBI, the rest is on you&quot;.  This changes the morals of how we treat people in the worst times.<p>I wish all of the above wasn&#x27;t true.

Instead of discussing how car theft is fundamentally an unethical behavior, the discussion is about preventing some thing from being sold or existing, whether that be insecure vehicles or Flipper Zeroes.

And that adblock penetration rate increases year over year due to efforts like this.<p>The real question is what will happen next. Will the government move to rule adblocking illegal? Will websites engage in sophisticated technical anti-adblock measures? Will companies like Google and Twitter give up on advertising and shutter their existing businesses?

Until they have met them, assessed them, heard what they salary target is and weighed it up against their skills and experience and calibrated it against the team.<p>The conversation almost always goes like this: Employers come to me and say &quot;we want a great senior C# .NET developer&quot;.  I say &quot;what do you want to pay?&quot;.  They say &quot;don&#x27;t know, we just want someone great, what do you think we need to pay to get the right person?&quot;.  I say &quot;I think it will be about $X, but lets put a job ad up and indicate it&#x27;s top of range $ and see who we get.&quot;<p>It is also true that a single job ad might be aiming to employ a number of people at various positions of seniority and experience.<p>Government agencies are required to carefully define salary ranges because that is the way they work.  So it does not surprise me that governments would legislate to require job ads to do the same - essentially because of ignorance about how the world works.<p>If it makes you mad that job ads do not list salary, then there are good reasons and you will just have to get over or it not apply for that job.<p>It&#x27;s that easy - if the ad doesn&#x27;t specify salary and that is a key requirement for you, don&#x27;t get angry, just don&#x27;t apply.<p>Being angry about it or feeling that employers&#x2F;recruiters are playing some sort of manipulative game is ignoring the reality set out above.  And when you come into a position that requires recruiting, likely you&#x27;ll speak to your recruiter and say &quot;what do you think we&#x27;ll need to pay for someone like this?&quot;.<p>Far more important is to know the salary target that you are aiming for.<p>EDIT: lots of unhappy responses to this, but don&#x27;t shoot the messenger.

Or, you know, riots.<p>But I look around after reading those books and wonder what makes us so different. It&#x27;s weird to live in this era.

It&#x27;s tough.<p>The only silver lining I can think of is what all the secrecy says: <i>we&#x27;re not just doing this in the open because we&#x27;re still afraid we&#x27;ll end up like the Romanovs if too many of you get angry</i>. I think that while they&#x27;re still afraid, there&#x27;s still some hope.<p>EDIT: Reading some replies. It&#x27;s weird to have to say this to such a smart crowd, but I&#x27;m not advocating riots as such; I&#x27;m advocating a substantive response. Of course riots are &quot;bad&quot; in some sense, but my observation is really about the odd contrast between the huge size of the &quot;stimulus&quot; (theft of wealth, much of it <i>yours</i>, on a staggering scale) and the tiny size of the &quot;response&quot; (newspaper articles and web forum discussions), especially when contrasted with other historical periods.

At even 30 an hour, it&#x27;s saved the developer $4,680, or at 60&#x2F;hour, close to $10,000, but I can guarantee that 99% of developers will not spend $30&#x2F;month to make their lives easier.<p>My only recommendation is try to sell this product to businesses and maybe offer them a deal based on the amount of developers they have. So sell it do a dev shop with 10 developers at $20&#x2F;developer &#x2F; per month.

I find this technically impressive and makes a lot of old DOS software indistinguishable from native linux software; stdin&#x2F;stdout, parameters, host filesystem access, etc all work transparently.<p>Here&#x27;s a screenshot: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;taviso&#x2F;status&#x2F;1272670107043368960&#x2F;photo&#x2F;1\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;taviso&#x2F;status&#x2F;1272670107043368960&#x2F;photo&#x2F;...</a><p>It can import TTF fonts and print to PostScript, which I just pipe into ps2pdf and then handle on the host.<p>I&#x27;m not aware of any other full-featured modern word processor that can run in an xterm. I know about wordgrinder but it&#x27;s very very basic. You could use a text editor, but it&#x27;s not ideal for layout because it doesn&#x27;t understand things like proportional font geometries - you need that to know how lines&#x2F;glyphs will fit on the physical page when it&#x27;s printed. You could write it in some form of markup, html, TeX, markdown, whatever, but if I&#x27;m just trying to format a document I prefer a word processor.<p>(Note: dosemu2 doesn&#x27;t require virtual 8086 mode, so it works fine on x86-64)</td>\n",

For context, I&#x27;m an African American, so many of my ancestors were slaves.<p><pre><code>  - The first time it occurred to me that &quot;master&quot; in this context could offend anyone was when GitHub changed the name (and broke my workflow).\\n  - My immediate reaction was, &quot;this change is by white people for white people,&quot; where &quot;white&quot; means anyone who isn&#x27;t black.\\n  - My next reaction was, &quot;they may be changing the name for the wrong reasons, but the change is brilliant.&quot;\\n</code></pre>\\nLet me explain a little more. Whether motivated purely by virtue signaling or by more genuine intentions, changing the name doesn&#x27;t fix any of the problems that black people face. The article explains this well.<p>What&#x27;s powerful about <i>this</i> name change is that it pushes us to alter a <i>habit</i>, in my case one embedded deeply in my fingers, something that I do every day without realizing that I&#x27;m doing it. Thus it is a useful reminder of the implicit bias that contributes to the lack of diversity in tech. Never mind that the old name was harmless, the change brings repeated awareness to an important topic, and it reaches a the developer community in a targeted way.<p>So, next time you are annoyed that you have to fix a script or you accidentally type master when you needed to type main, please just take a deep breath, change the name, and remember to reflect upon whether you have are subconscious habits or biases that work against diversity in tech.</td>\n",

It was a pretty long journey for a weekend - it would sometimes take 10 hours one way since you had to go through New York. Of course, it was worth it.<p>But whenever we would go on a walk, or I'd take her out to dinner, I got as much face time with the back of that fucking iPhone as with her. We'd be strolling down the street during a beautiful summer sunset, and she'd be holding my hand with one of hers, and with the other she'd be scrolling through Instagram. Craning her neck to stare at that stupid dim little screen instead of just looking around at the beautiful neighborhood I lived in. Same thing while I tried talking to her during dinner. She literally preferred it to looking at what was around her.<p>Gawking at fake vintage photos. Or reading her horoscope. Or online shopping. Or whatever.<p>I asked her to stop, I said it was rude. She couldn't. I started to resent the iPhone, for stealing my limited time with her. I know, I know. It was a flaw in her, and not <i>everybody</i> does that, right?<p>Certainly not everybody. But I go to coffee shops now, I go to events, and people are just in cell phone huddles. A group of people will go out, and unanimously decide to prick and pinch and swipe their glass worship stones instead of having a fucking conversation or looking around them. This is <i>everywhere</i>. Every year it's more of a common sight. It's actually surprising now to see someone at the local cafe reading a book, or playing chess.<p>I might notice this more than most because I made a life decision to not use a \"smart phone\" and have kept using the same shitty Blackberry for 6 years now. It can only do calls, texts, and Sudoku. I couldn't do this kind of thing if I wanted.<p>I'm 20 now. I remember junior high, when the best cell phone was a Motorola RAZR. People never did this shit back then, because they couldn't. People spent time with each other. The cell phones would come out to facilitate people getting together, and then they'd go back in your pocket. That was it. They were actually phones. It was all they could do.<p>Phones today just aren't phones anymore. I don't know what to call them. They're more integrated with our lives. More intrusive. More attractive. They're addictive.[1] And they're used mostly for useless things.<p>Well, Google is taking the last remaining effort out of letting technology intervene with your actual life. And they know what to call it. Glass. Now you can <i>wear</i> it. It's a default. You don't have to pull it out. It's just always there. If this becomes normal, I will probably have to run away to the Third World or something.<p>I am crossing my fingers that we just stop at smart phones, and this never takes off. But I'm scared, because in the back of my head I am pretty certain it will. Eventually there will be no strangers, and there will be no friends. Everyone's name will be public, and nobody will get to know each other. Despite your dinky little social networks and social apps, you are forgetting what it is to actually know someone.<p>I really hope I don't ever have to go on a date with some girl who's getting conversation tips from Google's magic headgear.

This permits Apple to simply “console ban” any Apple device that spams on iMessage. This makes it prohibitively expensive to send spam over iMessage. They have been doing so since iMessage was launched.<p>Android offers no such attestation that I’m aware of. Windows, on Pluton, <i>could</i> offer this attestation securely — and that is a key deliverable of Pluton.<p>It’s easy, then, to predict what Apple’s first non-Apple platform will be: Microsoft Windows 12, only if secure-booted, with Pluton-signed attestation that the kernel is unmodified. And it’s easy to predict how Apple will implement anti-spam: by applying “console” bans to specific Pluton chips by their serial number.<p>If Android wants to join the party, then Android phone builders need to implement secure boot with hardware-signed attestation of non-rooted-ness, in the style of Apple T2 + macOS or Microsoft Pluton + Secure Boot. Until then, Apple iMessage will remain single platform.<p>(I recognize that this is extremely unpalatable to device hackers, but the same freedom to modify an OS kernel that hackers desire is also the freedom to spam all users, as we have seen repeatedly with all messaging software platforms operated without hardware-backed attestation for the past thirty years — including email, Jabber, and HN itself.)<p>(No, I do not work at Apple.)</td>\n",

And when you decide how, how do you scale it?<p>These are very hard questions, and it’s frustrating to read the phrase “we need to fix the system” because yes, obviously we do, but agreeing that things are bad isn’t the hard part, and probably input from people who have never worked in the field is of pretty limited value in how to resolve the hard part, and will not do much more than annoy teachers even more.<p>So what’s the solution then? Well, maybe we should start by rolling back this common conception that when it comes to schools, everyone’s opinion matters an equal amount, and then listen to the teachers and academics.<p>Cynically, this will never happen because reforms to battle educational issues in any democratic society usually takes more than 5 election cycles to show obvious results (and when the bad results start stacking up current leaders will take the flak regardless).</td>\n",

And if that’s the case, wouldn’t the energy companies eventually do this, which, given macro market laws of supply and demand, would eventually cause the price of electricity to go dramatically down for their end consumer, thus eliminating the financial benefit of privately installed roof top solar for homeowners?<p>I live in the southwest, and based on online calculators it “makes sense” from a 10 year outlook to pay the money now and install solar on my home, but that’s only if the energy prices don’t fall.

That&#x27;s not the story of the &quot;fat cats getting rich on the back of the workers&quot; that the article is alluding to.<p>The problem for the business is that the financial model is set by the fixed or imperative costs, i.e. the cost of rent, the cost of maintaining the capital equipment, the cost of cleaning to meet codes, insurance, etc.  The cost of labor, for cooks, wait staff, etc. is often the biggest part of the expense budget for restaurants.<p>With such a small profit margin, arbitrarily raising everyone&#x27;s wages is likely going to kill the business.  There is no room in the budget.  The only choice is to either automate, which will reduce the labor requirements, or raise prices and hope that customers won&#x27;t just go down the street.  But they will, they will go down the street--until everyone&#x27;s prices go up and there is nowhere else to go.  And all of this is free market capitalism at work.  It is a continuous process of reinvention.<p>In short, I&#x27;m not saying that higher wages aren&#x27;t necessary, I&#x27;m just saying that both sides of the equation need to be examined, i.e. the plight of the worker AND the plight of the business.  And we need to understand that things will probably get ugly before they get better.  Because that&#x27;s how capitalism and free market economies work.<p>But watch out for technology and automation...that is the part of the equation that has been &quot;solving&quot; the labor problem for some time now...</td>\n",

This data has never been, would never be, and will never be sold&#x2F;rented&#x2F;etc. to advertisers.<p>Stripe.js collects this data only for fraud prevention -- it helps us detect bots who try to defraud businesses that use Stripe. (CAPTCHAs use similar techniques but result in more UI friction.) Stripe.js is part of the ML stack that helps us stop literally millions of fraudulent payments per day and techniques like this help us block fraud more effectively than almost anything else on the market. Businesses that use Stripe would lose a lot more money if it didn&#x27;t exist. We see this directly: some businesses don&#x27;t use Stripe.js and they are often suddenly and unpleasantly surprised when attacked by sophisticated fraud rings.<p>If you don&#x27;t want to use Stripe.js, you definitely don&#x27;t have to (or you can include it only on a minimal checkout page) -- it just depends how much PCI burden and fraud risk you&#x27;d like to take on.<p>We will immediately clarify the ToS language that makes this ambiguous. We&#x27;ll also put up a clearer page about Stripe.js&#x27;s fraud prevention.<p>(Updated to add: further down in this thread, fillskills writes[1]: <i>&quot;As someone who saw this first hand, Stripe’s fraud detection really works. Fraudulent transactions went down from ~2% to under 0.5% on hundreds of thousands of transactions per month.

In turn, Casey rightly did not acknowledge it except to tell his followers that it was not a real apology[2].<p>This blog post is matter-of-fact, but Casey is <i>right</i>. However, he said himself that it was trivial to do this. Is it not acceptable that we use the same language?<p>Casey, I&#x27;m sorry. We made a mistake. <i>I</i> made a mistake! We didn&#x27;t know what we didn&#x27;t know, and thought we were clever enough to pass for it.<p>Using a texture atlas was a great idea, and we didn&#x27;t know about it until you told us. We should do better to credit you.<p>[1]: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;devblogs.microsoft.com&#x2F;commandline&#x2F;windows-terminal-preview-1-13-release&#x2F;#new-rendering-engine\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;devblogs.microsoft.com&#x2F;commandline&#x2F;windows-terminal-...</a> (scroll down under the image)<p>[2]: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;cmuratori&#x2F;status&#x2F;1489406091318349826\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;cmuratori&#x2F;status&#x2F;1489406091318349826</a><p>--<p>(Note: I&#x27;ve iteratively edited this post, as it was originally a one-sentence diatribe written in anger.

We&#x27;ll try not to thread sit too much. :) In brief, the Developer Edition is a new release channel for Firefox, replacing Aurora (our pre-Beta channel). Everything else about the release cadence is the same.<p>There are four major new features here:<p>1. The Firefox Tools Adapter (&quot;Valence&quot;), which lets you use the Firefox dev tools to inspect and debug pages in Chrome for Android and Safari for iOS. The goal: one set of tools to debug any browser.<p>2. Side-by-side profiles. The Developer Edition defaults to a profile named `dev-edition-default`, which makes it easier to run Developer Edition at the same time as a normal release version of Firefox. You don&#x27;t have to deal with the profile switcher each time.<p>3. Developer-friendly defaults. Developer Edition ships with things like remote debugging and browser-chrome debugging enabled by default.<p>4. And, for all of you who hated Australis, a compact theme with square tabs.<p>But those are just consequences of the single biggest change:<p>5. We have a new channel, which new rules. And we want to use it to build the best possible browser for web developers. We can ship new tools that aren&#x27;t yet ready for the Beta channel, and we can change the browser&#x27;s appearance and defaults specifically for web developers.<p>We&#x27;ll be watching this thread during launch, but you can always submit feature requests on UserVoice.

But what concerns me about this is that Mozilla is such an important voice in shaping the future of the internet. To see it wither away because of people angry with what are, in the grand scheme of things, minor mistakes, is a shame.<p>EDIT: And lest you think I am embellishing about trivial complaints, there was a rant last week on r&#x2F;Firefox that Mozilla was allegedly conspiring to hide Gecko&#x27;s source code because we self-host our primary repo and bug tracking instead of using GitHub, despite the fact that the Mozilla project predates GitHub by a decade.</td>\n",

Kids have little or no slack in their schedule. This means very little freedom, and very little time to work things out mentally. School, practice, volunteer, homework, bed, do it all again. This builds up to a very difficult to unwind ball of stress, anger, fear and despair.<p>2. Everything is conflicted and unclear. Schools teach cultural tolerance while enforcing zero-tolerance policies. Diversity is good, but being ____ is bad. So many areas where what we teach and preach are the opposite of what policies and actions actually do.<p>3. The stakes are too high. View the wrong website on your chromebook and get referred to law enforcement. Have a kid send you the wrong selfie and get charged with a sex crime. Get a bad grade and you are off the volleyball team, and you won&#x27;t make the team next year - so done forever. Misbehave and you&#x27;ll be arrested by the resource officer and face time at juvi, and potentially a conviction that will be held against you for a very long time (in some states juvi convictions count against three strikes laws).<p>3.

Workers can&#x27;t usually live too much without finding a job.<p>That&#x27;s why minimum wage laws and workers rights are important. Companies will always push for lower wages wherever they can, without a care for the actual wealth created by the worker. The only way to counter that push is by giving more power to the worker, and in low-skilled fields with lots of available workers, you need to do that through regulations and subsidies.</td>\n",

Spent on goods or services from another company (including freelancers, contractors, etc.)<p>2. Spent on rent<p>3. Spent on capital purchases<p>4. Spent on wages<p>5. Spent on debt repayment or other forms of financing<p>6. Paid out in dividends<p>7. Spent on share buybacks<p>8. Invested in something else<p>Items 1-5 are all good things that we want companies to do, and corporation tax is normally applied after this spending is accounted for. Items 6 and 7 ought to be taxed, and frequently are (dividends and buybacks create income for individuals who will pay tax on that income). Item 8 is a bit vaguer, but probably shouldn&#x27;t be taxed in most cases (if we&#x27;re worried about companies parking cash in very low-risk assets, then super-low yields are effectively a tax on that anyway).<p>All that the corporation tax adds to this picture is the creation of work in tax avoidance services, and an unjust inequality between those firms that can afford those services and are structured to take advantage of the rules, and those that can not and are not.<p>It&#x27;s not obvious to me that corporation tax &#x2F;can&#x2F; be fixed, and so it may be better simply to scrap it and replace it with something more difficult to dodge.<p>EDIT: formatting</td>\n",

One of my daughters did a six month digital marketing bootcamp. She made $45k year one, and a year later is the director of marketing at her company making over $100k&#x2F;yr.<p>3) College is way over priced. They claim graduates make 40% over their lifetime vs. non grads. JP Morgan Chase did a study two years ago that shows kids that had a job, any job before age 18 make 35% more than their peers over their lifetime regardless of degree.<p>4) Student loans are a horror that needs to stop.

Why do I need to do Ctrl+Tab to switch tabs but Cmd+T to create tabs? Why is History not Cmd&#x2F;Ctrl+H in browsers? I need to memorize more shortcuts on MacOS for no reason, when it could very well just do it all with a single modifier key.<p>&gt; Hidden dock doesn&#x27;t appear unless I smash my cursor on the bottom edge.

Ok, then why Cmd + T to open a new tab in terminal instead of ctrl?<p>&gt; The shell startup time is too much on MacOS. I have to wait for a second for the shell to load before I start typing my commands. On Linux, pressing Ctrl+Alt+T and writing commands right away feels so good!<p>&gt; No package manager by default, brew is honestly very slow compared to Linux solutions.<p>MacOS isn&#x27;t unusable of course, I&#x27;d prefer it over Windows anyday but it just introduces a lot of UX friction Linux desktop just doesn&#x27;t.</td>\n",

For the entirety of my young life, school was a prison. With inmates who would beat you, Emotionally abuse you, the “wardens” did not want to be there either, and did not care how the other inmates treated you… sometimes doubling down on the behaviour themselves. - The comparison is further solidified by 6-foot galvanised steel bars surrounding the complex, and that I visited an actual psychiatric prison not long after and the cafeteria, recreational grounds, rooms, etc; were <i>identical</i> to those of my school.<p>Education? You probably mean repeating exercises in rote? You likely mean memorisation? That’s not education.<p>It took becoming an adult to learn for myself that I <i>enjoyed learning</i>. My school was not learning, Everything that got me through school was things that my mother taught me- And as a consequence, I was always top of my class.<p>I find it hard to think of school as anything more than forced internment for children while their parents go to work, with exercises designed to keep you busy more than to give a functional understanding. I would not be surprised if this feeling is shared among many of my generation and social class, the endless chasing of metrics has made even the tiniest amount of joy that could exist in school- Non-existent.<p>and for those saying it was good for socialisation with other children- The ostracised, are learning to be helpless and to be victims- They are not learning to “socialise” more.

When I walk around town I see tons and tons of places advertising jobs, for simple stuff like kitchen, moving stuff around, etc. I even recently saw a store with a &quot;talk to the manager and start working right now&quot; sign. And then I walk around the streets and see all these homeless. It seems like a paradox to me, but I am obviously missing some important detail here.<p>Of course I understand some drug addicts may not want a job or simply know they can&#x27;t last more than a few days in one, but I would imagine a lot of these homeless people I see on the streets would actually like to have an income and be able to live anywhere that&#x27;s not the streets. How do you reconcile that with the fact that there are so many simple jobs with open positions everywhere?<p>This is not supposed to be a sarcastic or politically loaded question. Where I come from, jobs are simply unavailable and at the moment you advertise it, even if it&#x27;s just flipping burgers, there are lines and lines of people competing for it. I fail to understand why the US is so different. Anybody would please be able to point me at what I&#x27;m missing?<p>Edit: also, people who can&#x27;t afford housing usually live with their families for a long time (or the whole life). Tiny houses with entire generations of families living in it are common. I guess this is still miles better than living in the streets.</td>\n",

The hard problem to solve is problem 4, and this is something you teach people how to do at a university level.<p>(I should add that another important problem is what is known as premise selection. I didn&#x27;t list that because LLMs have actually been shown to manage this ok in about 70% of theorems, which basically matches records set by other machine learning techniques.)<p>(Real mathematical research also involves what is known as lemma conjecturing. I have never once observed an LLM do it, and I suspect they cannot do so. Basically the parameter set of the LLM dedicated to mathematical reasoning is either large enough to model the entire solution from end to end, or the LLM is likely to completely fail to solve the problem.)<p>I personally think this entire article is likely complete bunk.<p>Edit: after reading replies I realise I should have pointed out that humans do not simply backtrack. They learn from failed attempts in ways that LLMs do not seem to. The material they are trained on surely contributes to this problem.</td>\n",

I owned a DK2 -- I followed every shred of VR news like a fanatic. And what I learned from being so involved with VR was that it is not ready for mass adoption and probably never will be. People in the VR community drastically underplay nausea and discomfort. The main flaw is that if you move in the virtual world but not in the real world, your body does not like it. Thanks to head tracking, you can move the camera wherever you can move your head without sickness because the movement in the real world and virtual world are the same. But if you want to move around in any greater capacity than that without making 50% of people sick immediately, and perhaps 80% sick after just a few hours, then you have to do full body tracking. We are talking about 3&#x2F;4 of games, easily. Games where you are a character and you run around in virtual space.<p>Even if you do full body tracking in your home, you are going to be extremely limited. You&#x27;ll be running into the boundaries of your play space constantly. Those tricks of perception that allow you to walk along a curve instead of a straight line and thus never hit a boundary require very large amounts of space, especially if it is done in a way that is not detectable at all by the user. &quot;What about omni-directional treadmills?&quot; At this point I think we are getting crazy. Not only are you buying a hugely expensive VR headset, but you are setting aside a huge space in your home and buying a fucking gigantic omni-directional treadmill. Plus, the treadmill also does not provide the bodily acceleration required to prevent sickness because you are stationary relative to the earth while you use it.<p>And all of this is assuming that VR headsets reach a place where we have full FOV, perfect resolution and extremely high refresh rates. And VR headsets that have all of that will never be affordable unless they become popular. And they probably won&#x27;t because of the reasons that I have just explained to you.<p>The one thing that I think has the potential to make VR popular is monitor replacement. Other than that, when I look at the future of this kind of technology I see AR. Not VR. I am sorry Rift fans, it was painful for me too.</td>\n",

I will be very disappointed if they add back in USB-A&#x2F;HDMI&#x2F;SD ports, or remove USB-C charging in favor of proprietary charge port. Sounds like unnecessary feature bloat. Please just do MagSage + USB-C, so I can maintain my one-cable-for-everything, making traveling lighter and simpler. Here&#x27;s my counter argument to all those that love MagSafe: makes traveling a huge hassle, forcing me to carry a special charge brick that only works for ONE device. In 2021 going forward, I will flat refuse to spend money on anything that doesn&#x27;t use USB-C or Qi charging. I can now travel with a single 2xUSB-C power brick, and charge all devices from the same cable. This is a huge step forward, please don&#x27;t reverse this.<p>I am all for removing the TouchBar. The new MacBook Air with TouchID + physical function keys is a perfect combination of features. There are a few things about the TouchBar I do like -- eg, having a custom one-touch screen lock button that&#x27;s always present. However vast majority of the time I use external keyboard+trackpad+monitor, so the touchbar can&#x27;t be part of my usual workflow anyway. Removing this reduces cost and complexity.<p>Please.

I&#x27;m in the process of moving everything on NewsBlur over to Docker containers in prep for the big redesign launching next week. It&#x27;s been a great year of maintenance and I&#x27;ve enjoyed the fruits of Ansible + Docker for NewsBlur&#x27;s 5 database servers (PostgreSQL, MongoDB, Redis, Elasticsearch, and soon ML models).<p>About two hours before this happened, I switched the MongoDB cluster over to the new servers. When I did that, I shut down the original primary in order to delete it in a few days when all was well. (Thank goodness I did that! It&#x27;ll come in handy a few hours from now).<p>Turns out the ufw firewall I enabled and diligently kept on a strict allowlist with only my internal servers didn&#x27;t work on a new server because of Docker. When I containerized MongoDB, Docker helpfully inserted an allow rule into iptables, opening up MongoDB to the world. So while my firewall was &quot;active&quot;, doing a `sudo iptables -L | grep 27017` showed that MongoDB was open the world. More info on SO[1].<p>To be honest, I&#x27;m a bit surprised it took over 3 hours from when I flipped the switch to when a script kiddie dropped NewsBlur&#x27;s MongoDB collections, and ransomed about 250GB of data. I am now running a snapshot on that old primary, just in case it reconnects to a network and deletes everything. Once done, I&#x27;ll boot it up, secondary it out, and be back in business.

But that was before the surprising massive success of iPhones in 2007.  Now, it seems like sales of Logic would be a insignificant rounding error in Apple&#x27;s revenue.  If Mac software portfolio was that big a deal, I&#x27;m not sure why they discontinued Aperture instead of Logic.  It seems like there&#x27;s a bigger market of customers that would catalog and modify photos rather than record music.<p>Intuit sold off Quicken to a private equity firm and yet Apple continues to own and develop Logic.  I like Apple&#x27;s stewardship of Logic but I can&#x27;t understand its strategic value to today&#x27;s Apple.<p>Anybody have any thoughts on what Logic does for Apple that Aperture didn&#x27;t?<p>EDIT to several replies about &quot;enhancing brand image&quot;:  That&#x27;s plausible but AVID Pro Tools is even more prestigious than Logic and AVID&#x27;s market cap is only $250 million[0].

The reality is you still have to free resources, so it&#x27;s not like the garbage collector is doing work that doesn&#x27;t need to be done. What latency budgets are you working with? How often do you do work to free resources? What are the latency requirements there? Even at 144 fps, that&#x27;s 7ms per frame. If you have a garbage collector that runs in 200us, you could run a GC on every single frame and use less than 3% of your frame budget on the GC pause. I&#x27;m -not- suggesting that running a GC on every frame is a good idea or that it should be done, but what I find so deeply frustrating is that the argument that GC can&#x27;t work in a game engine is never qualified.<p>edit: wow for once the replies are actually good, very pleased with this discussion.</td>\n",

The latter is clearly really difficult to do.<p>Without a stream of new ideas and products (unlike, say, Apple) Facebook double-downed on maximising revenue growth from their core advertising business. This led to all the scandals and disasters they have brought us, including destabilising societies.<p>Inevitably, this led to the core product becoming less attractive, and people were also turned off by the negative press. Zuckerberg&#x27;s rigid control of the company has led to him being a lightening rod for the backlash against big tech and especially adtech. His media skills are awful, so insisting on control and making himself a figurehead has further damaged the business.<p>Zuckerberg knows the only way out is another home run. He&#x27;s a super smart and prescient thinker, so he can see VR is a good play. It looks like the timeline for VR won&#x27;t be short enough to save FB, but even if it were arriving soon enough he must know that FB probably isn&#x27;t capable of delivering a truly new thing.<p>This then marks the beginning of the end for the company, as it continues to bring in revenue from Instagram and monetises Whatsapp. Its sheer size means decline is going to take decades.<p>I wouldn&#x27;t be surprised if Zuckerberg leaves in the next few years, before the failure of Meta strategy becomes apparent.<p>What they _should_ have done is debatable, but developing some sense of ethics might have helped. I think they could have focused on building Whatsapp into a payments (etc) app, which would have created an enduring product, and then used the time that bought them to rebuild the company.<p>Microsoft are showing that it can be done, but I wonder if Facebook has the capacity to do great things. Perhaps the lesson from MS is that only a new leader can rescue such a mired company.</td>\n",

I like to think I&#x27;m generally an optimist, but I think it&#x27;s been clear for several weeks now that this is going to have a significant worldwide impact.<p>There are just too many factors in favor of uncontained worldwide spread at this point - within the 1st week of reporting it already looked like China&#x27;s numbers were incomplete (and potentially manipulated) and the scale was greatly underestimated.<p>Untraceable transmission all over the place, relatively low-traffic countries like Nepal and Sri Lanka seeing cases very early on, extremely long incubation periods with airborne transmission without symptoms, false negative tests with people either catching the virus after leaving quarantine or not testing positive (both really bad signs), governments demonstrating weak and ineffective containment of potentially infected travelers (Japan: &quot;no symptoms so they can go home!&quot;), more infections than SARS in a small fraction of the time, the US only testing ~400 people thus far, entire families in Wuhan being wiped out. Basically everything is in place for this to be a serious pandemic.<p>I think when this all comes to an end, China will be one of the countries that dealt with the virus the best. Countries without authoritarian governments likely don&#x27;t have the means to effectively quarantine major cities and shut down massive portions of their economy immediately without major problems arising. Given a couple weeks, sure, but by then it will be too late.<p>As an aside, BNO has been doing an excellent job of posting timely and sourced updates that make it easy to keep up to date with every new confirmed case (scroll down to the Timeline section):<p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;bnonews.com&#x2F;index.php&#x2F;2020&#x2F;02&#x2F;the-latest-coronavirus-cases&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;bnonews.com&#x2F;index.php&#x2F;2020&#x2F;02&#x2F;the-latest-coronavirus...</a><p>Hopefully I can look back at this comment in a couple months and chuckle at my paranoia!</td>\n",

But in the culture of software development, there does seem to be an ambient message often repeated or hinted at, that it is good to &quot;give back&quot; to open source by contributing and that it is virtuous to do so.<p>I now am starting to rethink this sentiment because the vast majority of the benefit of open source contributions on github, be they to languages, runtimes, application frameworks, databases, etc, go towards increasing the bottom line of for-profit companies, not to developers. And the vast majority of the beneficiaries of open source will never support the project even when they are fortune 50 companies saving millions of dollars by using the work of one volunteer.<p>There is also the idea that contributing will be great for your career development. I have found that not to be the case at all, I think that no potential or current employer has ever given a rat&#x27;s ass about open source contributions, and do not consider that work as valuable when making hiring decisions. The work you are paid to do is the only thing anyone cares about. I&#x27;m not saying that that shouldn&#x27;t be the case, but just that that is the case.<p>Given then, that there&#x27;s very little upside to doing open source, and most&#x2F;all the benefits go to profit-making corporations, it is puzzling why do we even push for greater involvement in open source at all? It seems we shouldn&#x27;t be, we should be warning people who want to contribute to Open Source that they should probably spend their time doing their own studying and personal&#x2F;skill development which will allow them to succeed in the roles that they have with their current role or a role they&#x27;d like to obtain one day, for money.</td>\n",

The consensus on HN seems to be that you can be pretty productive with LLMs as coding assistants, but every time I try I find it borderline impossible to get functional code even for pretty straightforward prompts.<p>I decided to fire up GPT-4o again today to see if maybe things have gotten better over the past few months.<p>I asked GPT to write code to render a triangle using Vulkan (a 3D graphics API). There are about 1000 tutorials on this that are almost certainly in GPT-4&#x27;s training data. I gave GPT two small twists so it&#x27;s not a simple case of copy&#x2F;paste: I asked it 1) to apply a texture to the triangle and 2) to keep all the code in a single function. (Most tutorials break the code up into about a dozen functions, but each of these functions are called only once, so it should be trivial to inline them.)<p>Within the first ten lines, the code is already completely nonfunctional:<p>GPT-4o declares a pointer (VkPhysicalDevice) that is uninitialized. It queries the number of graphics devices on the host machine. A human being would allocate a buffer with that number of elements and store the reference in the pointer. GPT-4o just ignores the result. Completely ignores it. So the function call was just for fun, I guess? It then tries to copy an entire array of VkPhysicalDevice_T objects into this uninitialized pointer. So that&#x27;s a guaranteed memory access violation right off the bat.</td>\n",

Without the distributed build, a from-scratch build of Chrome will take at least 30 minutes on a Macbook Pro--maybe an hour(!). TBH I don&#x27;t remember toughing out a full build without resorting to goma. Even on a hefty workstation, a full build is a go-for-lunch kind of interruption. It will absolutely <i>own</i> a machine.<p>How did we get here? Well, C++ and its stupid O(n^2) compilation complexity. As an application grows, the number of header files grows because, as any sane and far-thinking programmer would do, we split the complexity up over multiple header files, factor it into modules, and try to create encapsulation with getter&#x2F;setters. However, to actually have the C++ compiler do inlining at compile time (LTO be damned), we have to put the definitions of inline functions into header files, which greatly increases their size and processing time. Moreover, because the C++ compiler needs to see full class definitions to, e.g., know the size of an object and its inheritance relationships, we have to put the main meat of every class definition into a header file! Don&#x27;t even get me started on templates. Oh, and at the end of the day, the linker has to clean up the whole mess, discarding <i>the vast majority</i> of the compiler&#x27;s output due to so many duplicated functions. And this blowup can be huge. A debug build of V8, which is just a small subsystem of Chrome, will generate about 1.4GB of .o files which link to a 75MB .so file and 1.2MB startup executable--that&#x27;s a 18x blowup.<p>Ugh. I&#x27;ve worked with a lot of build systems over the years, including Google&#x27;s internal build system open sourced as Bazel. While these systems have scaled C++ development far further than ever thought possible, and are remarkable in the engineering achievement therein, we just need to step back once in a while and ask ourselves:<p>Damn, are we doing this wrong?</td>\n",

There&#x27;s enough gross margin to produce a $B company just by selling webcams [0], especially if you can actually get customers excited about the product.<p>- A big reason there hasn&#x27;t been innovation is that the space doesn&#x27;t attract entrepreneurs (because hardware is viewed as hard) or investors (because hardware is viewed as hard).<p>- Size isn&#x27;t everything. As the iPhone shows, you can get very good image quality from a tiny sensor and lens if you have the right tech supporting it.

Then enter some syntactic sugar for the event loop. And since JS is popular, async became popular.<p>Code written using threads is, at least to me, much more readable and easier to reason about. Each section in itself is just synchronous code. The runtime&#x2F;kernel take care of concurrency. The overhead is negligible in a day when we have greenlet implementations. It works for both i&#x2F;o bound concurrency and cpu bound parallel computing. It doesn&#x27;t require entire libraries rewritten to support it. There is no callback hell. It scales both horizontically and vertically. Modern languages support it out of the box (Hello `go` keyword).<p>I realise that this is going to get a lot of downvotes. I don&#x27;t really care.

So in the case of this commit example would be the very simple message of a generic &quot;US-ASCII error&quot; problem. Everything they talk about in this article is what is great about the _rest_ of the commit message, which, given modern tools, is _almost never_ seen by anyone.<p>The main problem is that Git was built so that the commit message is the _email body_, meant to be read by everyone in the project. But for better or worse, that is not generally the role of this text today. Almost nobody ever sees it. Unless it&#x27;s discussed in a bunch of patch series over a mailing list, nobody reads anything other than the first 50 chars of the headline. It&#x27;s actively difficult to do, by nearly every tool built around the Git ecosystem.<p>Even if you&#x27;re _very good_ at Git, finding the correct invocation of &quot;git blame&quot; (is it &quot;-w -C -C -C&quot;? Or just _two_ dash C&#x27;s?) to even find the right messages that are relevant to the code blocks you care about is not widely known and even if you find them, still only show the first line. Then you need to &quot;git show&quot; the identified commit SHA to get this long form message. There is just no good way to find this information, even if it&#x27;s well written.<p>This is one of my biggest complaints with Git (or, indeed, any VCS before it), and I think why people just don&#x27;t care much about good commit messages. It&#x27;s just not easy to get this data back once it&#x27;s written.<p>If you want an example of this, search through the Git project&#x27;s history. Run a blame on any file. It&#x27;s _so hard_ to figure out a story of any function implementation in any file, but the commit messages are _pristine_. Paragraphs and paragraphs of high quality explanation for almost every single commit. Look at any single commit that Jeff King has done for the last decade. Hundreds of hours of amazing documentation from a true genius that almost nobody will ever appreciate. It&#x27;s horrifying.<p>I don&#x27;t know exactly what the answer is, but the sad truth of Git is that writing amazing documentation via commit message, for most communities, is almost entirely a waste of time. It&#x27;s just too difficult to find them.</td>\n",

It&#x27;s my intuition from experience that we have a LONG way to go.<p>GPT-4o &#x2F; Claude 3.5 are the go-to models for my team. Every combination of technical investment + LLMs yields a new list of potential applications.<p>For example, combining a human-moderated knowledge graph with an LLM with RAG allows you to build &quot;expert bots&quot; that understand your business context &#x2F; your codebase &#x2F; your specific processes and act almost human-like similar to a coworker in your team.<p>If you now give it some predictive &#x2F; simulation capability - eg: simulate the execution of a task or project like creating a github PR code change, and test against an expert bot above for code review, you can have LLMs create reasonable code changes, with automatic review &#x2F; iteration etc.<p>Similarly there are many more capabilities that you can ladder on and expose into LLMs to give you increasingly productive outputs from them.<p>Chasing after model improvements and &quot;GPT-5 will be PHD-level&quot; is moot imo. When did you hire a PHD coworker and they were productive on day-0 ? You need to onboard them with human expertise, and then give them execution space &#x2F; long-term memories etc to be productive.<p>Model vendors might struggle to build something more intelligent. But my point is that we already have so much intelligence and we don&#x27;t know what to do with that. There is a LOT you can do with high-schooler level intelligence at super-human scale.<p>Take a naive example. 200k context windows are now available. Most people, through ChatGPT, type out maybe 1500 tokens. That&#x27;s a huge amount of untapped capacity. No human is going to type out 200k of context.

You can disagree with the law, but the law is there.<p>Now, the judge ordered Whatsapp to share a particular user conversation (a suspect murderer - edit: drug dealer). But the problem is: Whatsapp have no offices or operations in Brazil. The order was sent to Facebook, who ignore as Whatsapp is another company. So, without any executives in Brazil that could be held responsible for disobeying the law, the judge fine the company. They continue to disobey the order (for months). The judge suspends Whatsapp activity (for 24h a few months ago, but that order was suspended itself after a few hours). Now Whatsapp continue to disobey the judge&#x27;s order until this day. The  judge suspend the company again.<p>All arguments I hear against the judge is in the line that Whatsapp is &quot;too big to fail&quot;. That&#x27;s not a valid point in my opinion. If they disobey the law, it must have consequences, no matter how big and important to brazilian society they are. If they had operations and executives in Brazil this would never had happened at the first place. They would have lawyers fighting against the decision to share the user data and this would be solved by the justice system (never coming to have its activity suspended).\\nBut Whatsapp simply ignored brazilian justice system as if it was above the law.<p>It is very unfortunate that it came to this point, but it is not like a judge decided yesterday that Whatsapp should sufer for whatever reason. They got a lot of months of warning for this. And he is acting completely according to the law. For me, all of this is Whatsapp fault.</td>\n",

It&#x27;s inevitable; fossil fuels are on the way out.  What does that mean, besides lower carbon?<p>It means that countries which rely on fossil fuels for their economy, are going to see the same kind of crushing economic decline that, say, the UK coal industry has.<p>What do you suppose happens when, for example, Saudi Arabia can no longer feed itself?

The change in energy sources to lower-carbon ones is an old one, and there&#x27;s no way to stop it, nor should we try.  Wood gave way to coal and then oil and then natural gas, and the process will continue with zero-carbon sources like photovoltaics.  That&#x27;s a bullet that&#x27;s already been fired, and there&#x27;s no way to stuff it back inside the barrel of the gun.<p>But, do we really have a plan for the consequences, not only in Saudi Arabia but also every other nation that&#x27;s dependent on oil?

America is up there in the number of road deaths. Lower speeds and smaller vehicles would lower this.<p>- Bike infrastructure can be used for walking. Walking is good. This promotes accessibility for a large range of people, notably children and elders.<p>- Bikes require less space to park, a lot less. This extra space can be used to build more housing.

We still couldn&#x27;t compete with conventional electricity plants, even with a $30&#x2F;tonne price on carbon in Canada.<p>Geothermal energy is the same: sustainable, long-life electricity with no &quot;fuel&quot; costs, but it costs 2-3x as much to build a geothermal plant (in most areas, depends on geology) as e.g. a natural gas turbine powered plant, so the overall cost of electricity is much higher and you can&#x27;t get financing.<p>How is fusion different? The fuel will be free and unlimited, but the &quot;levelized cost of electricity&quot;, dominated by the capital cost of the plant, will still be much higher than other sources of electricity. I don&#x27;t think there&#x27;s a world -- even one where the onerous regulations go away and a  market price on carbon is available -- where the LCOE of fusion power is less than that from natural gas, or even close.</td>\n",

If you would not eat a spoon of every single ingredient of some food, don&#x27;t eat it.\\n- ban all added sugar, except (real) honey in reasonable proportions.<p>This implies to know&#x2F;learn how to cook (not so hard but this is easier when the local&#x2F;family culture allowed you to learn passively).<p>It looks like this is hard to do in the USA: you don&#x27;t easily find, for example, yogurt without sugar added.

As a result, they purchased a large amount (over $80bn!) in mortgage backed securities (MBS) with these deposits for their hold-to-maturity (HTM) portfolio.<p>- 97% of these MBS were 10+ year duration, with a weighted average yield of 1.56%.<p>- The issue is that as the Fed raised interest rates in 2022 and continued to do so through 2023, the value of SVB’s MBS plummeted. This is because investors can now purchase long-duration &quot;risk-free&quot; bonds from the Fed at a 2.5x higher yield.<p>- This is not a liquidity issue as long as SVB maintains their deposits, since these securities will pay out more than they cost eventually.<p>- However, yesterday afternoon, SVB announced that they had sold $21bn of their Available For Sale (AFS) securities at a $1.8bn loss, and were raising another $2.25bn in equity and debt. This came as a surprise to investors, who were under the impression that SVB had enough liquidity to avoid selling their AFS portfolio.&quot;<p>[1] - <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;jamiequint&#x2F;status&#x2F;1633956163565002752\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;jamiequint&#x2F;status&#x2F;1633956163565002752</a></td>\n",

The problem is it&#x27;s extremely difficult to say, figure out when someone might have invented some super clever idea which can be pantented &quot;on their own time&quot;.   This was true when I worked for MIT, VA Linux, IBM, and Google.   At VA Linux it was the VC&#x27;s which insisted on that clause in the employee&#x27;s contracts.   So anyone who think this is some evidence of Google being, or becoming, evil is either seriously misinformed, or just engaging in unthinking hate of Google, or both.<p>In fact, Google has one of the most permissive IP policies that I&#x27;ve seen at any company except for VA Linux Systems. \\n The default is that the vast majority of work done by an employee can be released under an open source license.  Sure, there&#x27;s a process that you have to go through, and unless what you want to do intersects with work that you are doing for your team that isn&#x27;t intended to be released publically, or competes with a critical company initiative, the default answer is that it will be allowed to be released.<p>This is <i>not</i> true for many, if not most companies, and as a responsible open source maintainer, I make sure that people understand they have permission from their company before I accept their open source contributions.  Otherwise, I would be putting them, and the project, at risk.   (Note that because of this, there are many employees which are not allowed to participate in open source development, because their employers will not give them permission to release code written by an employee under an open source license, whether written &quot;on their own time&quot; or not.)<p>At Google, once you get this (mostly pro forma) permission, you can work on open source projects on your own time, or on 20% time, using company laptops, or using GCE resources, etc.   When I was hired at Google, my manager and I cut a deal such that I could work on Linux Kernel and community projects for 50% of my time, instead of the normal 20%.   Sure, the overlap between what was good for Google and what was good for ext4&#x2F;Linux was pretty broad, but Google also paid for me to travel to various conferences in Asia, Australia, Europe, etc.<p>Also unique to Google is there is a process by which you can get permission for you to out-and-out own the work done on your own time, as opposed to Google owning it and releasing it under an open source license.   If you take that option then it really has to be done on your own time, and must not use any company resources, meaning not on a company laptop, or on a company network, etc.   This is rare, and I&#x27;m not aware of many other companies that give employees that option.</td>\n",

Last week, iOS decided to randomly delete all of my saved locations in the Maps app. I&#x27;ve never had stable, fast internet anywhere I&#x27;ve lived in the US in the past 8 years - every few days or so, shit just doesn&#x27;t work for a bit. I&#x27;ve owned things like a Nest or Philips Hue in the past, and they randomly reset to factory mode or desync&#x27;d from my phone . Half the time I try to play my PS4, some stupid patch fails to download, or PSN is down, etc.<p>The more things like the Amazon Echo I would have in my house, the more irritating my daily life would be - because I don&#x27;t want to deal with the 5% of the time where I have to repeat my request 5 times for it to tell me the weather, or the connection to the Amazon server is lost and I can&#x27;t play any music. This 5% of the time across dozens of devices results in being annoyed 100% of the time.<p>All of this is why I mainly use a record player to listen to music at home (no DRM, no problem with servers being down or albums removed remotely), really like my GameCube for video games (put a disk in and play, no patches to download), still exclusively buy paper books, am fine with dumb light switches, and so on.<p>If you think this entire thing is ridiculous, I fully agree - I make my living contributing to this industry!

The strength of computers has always been the ability to analyze literally incomprehensible (to humans) amounts of data and derive unique insights from them, and current machine learning has magnified this ability several-fold. AIs have now repeatedly been dropped into all kinds of video games and gone from morons to competent to beating all human players and exploiting bugs no one even knew existed. In a grim sense war is just another game. It has constraints, resources, definable win and loss states, etc. Consider that conflicts have often tilted based on a single novel strategy discovered by limited human commanders, and then ponder what an AI that improves its Mario speedrun via nearly imperceptible collision glitches could do.<p>Potentially, weapons don&#x27;t matter as much as how well you can use them.</td>\n",

Even these basics are more difficult in VSCode.<p>To me the future is IntelliJ for Java and all other languages should seek to have such a nicely integrated experience with an IDE.<p>I am not even sure I could write Java from scratch in Vim - its really that I&#x27;m using IntelliJ, not writing Java.

Resumes are meaningless, and often re-written by recruiters to match the job anyway.  Everyone has the same canned answers to the stupid behavioral questions.

You own a home in a neighborhood, you pay property tax that funds the schools. You drive a car, you pay gasoline tax that funds the streets. You hire workers locally, you pay the tax to pay back all the contributions public institutions made to adding the skills to the worker.<p>But the idea that a company like Amazon owes some tax to France doesn&#x27;t make sense. Sure the delivery person uses the roads, but they pay the gasoline tax and the delivery company pays taxes. What public resources did Amazon, a US company, use from France?<p>The other theories of taxation is that it should be used to raise revenue from the best means possible. I disagree with that framework but applying taxes arbitrarily hardly seems fair or the best way to raise revenue.<p>The other argument is that the government should &quot;level the playing field&quot;. But again arbitrarily punishing or helping some corporations opens up the possibility of corruption and corporate meddling as corporations look for favors. Much of the edge Amazon has versus local retailers is that it is more efficient. It doesn&#x27;t take up store space (and pay taxes on the land) and it doesn&#x27;t have to hire a lot of local workers (and pay taxes on their salaries).

You can&#x27;t change a single line of code in the product without breaking 1000s of existing tests. Generations of programmers have worked on that code under difficult deadlines and filled the code with all kinds of crap.<p>Very complex pieces of logic, memory management, context switching, etc. are all held together with thousands of flags. The whole code is ridden with mysterious macros that one cannot decipher without picking a notebook and expanding relevant pats of the macros by hand. It can take a day to two days to really understand what a macro does.<p>Sometimes one needs to understand the values and the effects of 20 different flag to predict how the code would behave in different situations. Sometimes 100s too! I am not exaggerating.<p>The only reason why this product is still surviving and still works is due to literally millions of tests!<p>Here is how the life of an Oracle Database developer is:<p>- Start working on a new bug.<p>- Spend two weeks trying to understand the 20 different flags that interact in mysterious ways to cause this bag.<p>- Add one more flag to handle the new special scenario. Add a few more lines of code that checks this flag and works around the problematic situation and avoids the bug.<p>- Submit the changes to a test farm consisting of about 100 to 200 servers that would compile the code, build a new Oracle DB, and run the millions of tests in a distributed fashion.<p>- Go home. Come the next day and work on something else. The tests can take 20 hours to 30 hours to complete.<p>- Go home. Come the next day and check your farm test results. On a good day, there would be about 100 failing tests. On a bad day, there would be about 1000 failing tests. Pick some of these tests randomly and try to understand what went wrong with your assumptions. Maybe there are some 10 more flags to consider to truly understand the nature of the bug.<p>- Add a few more flags in an attempt to fix the issue. Submit the changes again for testing. Wait another 20 to 30 hours.<p>- Rinse and repeat for another two weeks until you get the mysterious incantation of the combination of flags right.<p>- Finally one fine day you would succeed with 0 tests failing.<p>- Add a hundred more tests for your new change to ensure that the next developer who has the misfortune of touching this new piece of code never ends up breaking your fix.<p>- Submit the work for one final round of testing. Then submit it for review. The review itself may take another 2 weeks to 2 months. So now move on to the next bug to work on.<p>- After 2 weeks to 2 months, when everything is complete, the code would be finally merged into the main branch.<p>The above is a non-exaggerated description of the life of a programmer in Oracle fixing a bug. Now imagine what horror it is going to be to develop a new feature. It takes 6 months to a year (sometimes two years!) to develop a single small feature (say something like adding a new mode of authentication like support for AD authentication).<p>The fact that this product even works is nothing short of a miracle!<p>I don&#x27;t work for Oracle anymore.

I&#x27;m not saying that the situation is good, but &quot;60% of New Yorkers are not earning a living wage&quot; is inaccurate. The existence of this grey economy makes it very difficult to measure income and expenses for a large proportion of New Yorkers.<p>[edit]: As an example, I have a friend who grew up in a working class family in south Brooklyn. His mother&#x27;s job was &quot;on the books&quot; and his father&#x27;s construction work was completely off-the-books, paid in cash. Everybody in the family was very aware of the amount of money you could deposit in a bank account, in a given time period, without attracting IRS attention.<p>Recently, they bought a building in Brooklyn for a low million dollar figure, after pooling together informal loans from family members and friends.

I was very hyped for the latter and left the theater disappointed.<p>You see, Villeneuve&#x27;s Dune has a great cast, insanely great cinematography and sets, but it is also very sterile, devoid of life and has very unimaginative directing. Some scenes were direct adaptations from the book, like Gom Jabbar scene, Shadout Mapes scene, and were very confusing for people who didn&#x27;t read the book. (why does that sand woman shout when Jessica says a certain word?). Paul&#x27;s awakening is very bland, too. His mentats were useless. De Vries was just a sad freak who stood nearby and then died. Hawat was in three scenes where he had any lines, and in two of which he counted expenses, and offered his resignation in the third. If I didn&#x27;t read the book I&#x27;d assume he&#x27;s some kind of accountant.<p>On the other hand, Lynch&#x27;s Dune also has a great cast, great music, great sets, and it also has the all-important dream-like mystic feel to it, which is completely absent in the new adaptation. Sure, it has a lot of script problems, which mostly boil down to far too short runtime, as moviegoers in 1984 weren&#x27;t ready for 2 part movies, so it had to cram the second part of the book in the final 20 minutes or so. Had it been two movies, it would have been much better.<p>One big improvement in Villeneuve&#x27;s adaptation is Momoa&#x27;s Idaho, who basically saved the movie for me. Lynch&#x27;s Idaho was very bland and died far too easily and non-consequentally. Other than his scenes, if I ever want to see some scene from Dune on Youtube, it&#x27;ll be Lynch&#x27;s (except &quot;the Guild doesn&#x27;t take your orders&quot;, if you know what I mean).</td>\n",

On the other hand, at what point do we accept that we have different viewpoints and live and let live?<p>The biggest one for me in recent history was Cloudflare arbitrarily deciding to stop hosting the Daily Stormer. Sure, DS is vile, but at the point we start enforcing censorship on a whim instead of hardened policies that aren&#x27;t selectively enforced, I think it becomes worrisome.<p>I guess I don&#x27;t have a problem with people deciding what messages they do and do not want to support, as much as I have a larger problem with the rest of the world handing them the reigns.<p>Centralization is the real evil, here. Why are we giving companies and people the right to silence vast amounts of voices and opinions on random whims?<p>Then you see counter-arguments, like &quot;well if you don&#x27;t want to get banned, don&#x27;t say bad things!&quot; But then, who decides what&#x27;s bad? The societal norms are shifting to a place where there are certain topics that <i>are not allowed to be discussed at all</i> even if looking at them from a critical lens. So, there are problems that people have, and things that need to be talked about, but they aren&#x27;t allowed to say anything about it. They can only reference the idea from some distant euphemism.<p>The ones that do use their voices are banished to the shadows where, not only do they not <i>stop</i> thinking and saying what they were before, but now they dig their heels in further. They spread out to forums that <i>will</i> have them, and incidentally tend to allow hate speech or inciting violence. So we&#x27;re taking the ideas we do not find palatable and sending them off to a distant land where the other bad ideas go to twist and tear and fester and rot.<p>To me, personally and anecdotally, this seems to be happening with increasing velocity. We&#x27;re tightening our grip on what speech is acceptable and using centralized services to force this control on ourselves, over a platform that has always been about the open exchange of ideas.<p>So what do we do? I don&#x27;t know. Privately-owned services should be free to censor. People should also continue to speak freely (if legal). I certainly think Net Neutrality is essential at this point, whether enforced via public infrastructure or some kind of over-arching regulation. But, there&#x27;s not much anyone can do in the current framework of things other than encourage decentralization. And I do, when I can.<p>Also, for the record, I&#x27;m a feminist, left-leaning socialist. So good luck writing me off as another conservative windbag who doesn&#x27;t understand the first amendment that&#x27;s crowing about censorship. I think censorship is a problem, whether it&#x27;s via private platforms or not.</td>\n",

I imagine some of these men are similar to me in the loneliness and not as lucky in finding someone, and it’s impossible for me to not feel something.<p>This is basically a red flag for any relationship.  If the only thing making or allowing a person to be happy in life is their partner then <i>something is wrong</i>.  Mental health is no joke and not being able to enjoy life is usually a symptom of an underlying cause.  Depression is probably the most common but anxiety disorders can be similarly hard.<p>I think that&#x27;s the strongest criticism of incels as well; having a romantic and sexual relationship is not a requirement for a happy life.  No one wants to be the partner that gives meaning to another person&#x27;s life, unless they&#x27;re also codependent in some way.  It&#x27;s emotionally draining to take on that kind of responsibility.<p>EDIT to add: the best explanation that I&#x27;ve heard for the feeling men have of basic unhappiness without romance and sex is toxic masculinity; the general societal rejection of deep emotional relationships between straight men.  Lonely?  Make strong friendships!  Spend your time with other men who like you and enjoy your company and validate you.  A partner is not a replacement for the natural circle of close friends humans are supposed to have.

Because it removes whoever gets the least first-place votes, the only improvement it gives is that a third-party candidate doesn&#x27;t <i>spoil</i> an election, because your second-place vote will still count. \\n(E.g. Nader wouldn&#x27;t have taken votes from Gore, so Gore would have won instead of Bush.) But you&#x27;re still stuck with one of the polarizing two-party candidates who will win.<p>Contrast this to the Borda Count [2], where points are assigned by rank. In this case, suppose about half of everyone votes first-place for an extreme liberal, and the other half vote first-place for an extreme conservative. But everyone votes second-place for a moderate centrist they can live with, and third-place for the opposite-party candidate they detest. With IRV, the centrist is ignored and one of the extremists will win. But with Borda, the centrist candidate will win.<p>So to really get away from the poisonous political polarization of our times, ranked choice is necessary, but it needs to be Borda or similar, <i>not</i> IRV.

It should just be baked into the single nightly cost, and not a separate cost where you have to do the math to figure it all out. They should kill fees all together.

People, myself certainly included, often criticize Apple for taking 30% of developer revenue for merely existing in it&#x27;s walled garden. Right or wrong, they control the ecosystem, so their ability to monopolize and heavily tax the App Store is unsurprising, they&#x27;re exercising their pricing power as much as they possibly can.<p>But how is it that on PC, where we have a mostly open field on which anyone can participate freely without a gatekeeper&#x27;s blessing, Steam managed to consolidate so much of the gaming marketplace that even a titan like Microsoft is throwing the towel and bowing to Steam&#x27;s cartelish 30%? I get that being the dominant two-sided marketplace of a given space is a strong network effect and moat, and consolidation is certainly convenient for users (I like having all my purchased games on a single account), but intuition tells me <i>Bethesda</i> doesn&#x27;t need Steam&#x27;s exposure to sell games or make new arrivals known (their announcement will go viral regardless), similarly to Riot, Mojang, Epic and co not listing on Steam. So I&#x27;ve always found it surprising they were dual listing their games in the first place, but the fact they&#x27;re now entirely giving up on direct selling is a testament to Steam&#x27;s might in the gaming industry.<p>Is Steam&#x27;s product particularly good and hard to reproduce from the publisher&#x27;s PoV, even one backed by Microsoft, to the extent it is hard to compete against with something like Microsoft Store? Or is this just another case of being early enough to establish the initial brand and let the self-fulfilling network effect kick in - with the userbase acting like gravity to bring in more users and developers - until it&#x27;s large enough that sheer force of habit&#x2F;inertia makes it quasi-&quot;indisruptible&quot;?<p>Either way, I found it fascinating how Valve turned into Steam, whether it was accidental or not, what a homerun pivot. Seems that is the way of the Internet, being first matters more than just about anything, having the superior product (not claiming there is one for game stores) is irrelevant if you&#x27;re remotely late, it just won&#x27;t matter how much cash you pour into a Microsoft Store or a Google+. My gut tells me Microsoft is salivating at the idea of buying out Steam, seems like a perfect fit for the conglomerate if it wasn&#x27;t for the scrutiny it would bring their way while they are positioning themselves as the good FAAMG.</td>\n",

They enable me to live a very normal life that would be impossible in a heavily pedestrian optimized environment. The fact that you don&#x27;t even consider some of the alternatives as viable - automated shared cars, electric cars, strong hybrids ... all of which solve the problems you identified (wasted space on parking, pollution, etc.) leads me to believe that you actually just hate cars, and not any of the (solvable) problems that are caused by their current embodiment.<p>Consider that everyone&#x27;s circumstances are not the same as yours. Have some compassion for your fellow humans.<p>EDIT:<p>To those who are saying that we&#x27;ll still allow those with disabilities to have cars: many states require that you be able to walk less then 200 feet to get a disabled plate. On most days, I can walk at least 500 ... so by almost all standards, I do not qualify. However, walking 5-600 feet doesn&#x27;t get you far enough to survive without a car.

He broke down that the human-made ice could be frozen in a freezer to a custom size&#x2F;shape, be a lot cleaner, consistent in how you make it, and chemically no different than H20 than naturally occurring frozen water. As you looked around the lecture hall, you started to see people’s brains unlock. He went on to explain cost efficiencies, ethics, challenges with conflict diamonds, and how you could make a perfect diamond at a fraction of the coast.<p>After a 30 minute lecture, he asked the question again. Surprisingly, the majority of the women still wanted natural diamonds although the number was less than the original amount that raised their hand. That was the point where I realized the strength of diamonds product branding.</td>\n",

And mega corporations should be heavily taxed instead of holding the country economically hostage. They jumpstart their companies off of government funding and R&amp;D and then act abused when asked to help give back.<p>Right now, the middle class is getting slammed with taxes. They make almost all their money through salary and get taxed heavily, while the super rich pay either no tax or a maximum of capital gains, so almost 40% or less than upper middle class in terms of percentage.<p>Corporations and the super rich have bought out democracy, and what is crazy is that they are supported by the very groups they intrinsically hate and hurt through their policies.</td>\n",

Why can&#x27;t Twitter just be happy being Twitter, knowing its limits and making a stable profit? Instead it&#x27;s more users, more VC money, more staff... constantly burning as quickly as possible. There&#x27;s a ceiling on every business; it&#x27;s all bound to come crashing down eventually if you don&#x27;t stop somewhere. Either you do it gracefully or hundreds of folks have to eventually lose their job unexpectedly (very sad).<p>Is the answer simply that earlier VCs put pressure on the executives to keep growing so they can multiply their investment?<p>Personally I dream of making a living establishing a patio11-type software business. Something where I can do a high quality job and own all of the decision-making. The ceiling doesn&#x27;t have to be very high for one guy to sustain himself, and software is appealing because you can automate away nearly all of the &quot;work&quot;.</td>\n",

Scotland &amp; London vs. Wales &amp; the rest of Britain.  The U.S. West Coast &amp; Northeast vs. the Farm Belt, Rust Belt, and Mountain states.  Croatia &amp; Slovenia vs. the rest of Yugoslavia.  The Baltic Republics vs. the rest of the USSR. Even in a Red State like Texas, Houston (on the coast) has gone democratic.<p>What happens if economic ties <i>between</i> coastal regions of major trading partners become greater than cultural ties <i>within</i> nations?<p>Here in California, some of the proposals about sending all the immigrants back to where they came from seem absurd.  The economy would cease to function.  On one of my teams of 10 people at Google, we had immigrants from Iceland, England, Vietnam, China, Taiwan, and India, and I was the <i>only</i> native-born American citizen.  California would sooner secede than deport all of its immigrants.<p>What if it actually came to that?  If push came to shove and the interior decided to push a nativist, nationalist agenda, what if the coastal regions that benefit significantly from trade were to say &quot;Okay, you guys can play with yourself, we&#x27;re going to play with the rest of the world.&quot;  Scotland has threatened to do exactly that, and is planning on holding another referendum on independence if Britain actually follows through on Brexit.<p>What sort of organizing principle would the world have then?  I haven&#x27;t seen anything historically like that - the closest would be the Roman Empire that rimmed the Mediterranean.  For most of recorded history, the primary means of production has been <i>land</i> and so fights have been over <i>land</i>, but over the last 150 years or so (contemporaneous with the nation-state as a social organizing principle, BTW), the primary means of production shifted to <i>capital</i>, and now it&#x27;s shifting to <i>information</i>.

Companies such as Epic, which provide the software that hospitals use to build databases of patient data, have been big winners in the new world of hospitals-depending-on-software. But did the doctors become more productive? By almost any measure, they became less productive.<p>People in tech keep thinking more tech will solve problems and they keep underestimating the flexibility of the old models. For instance, most large companies used to be run by armies of secretaries, and the senior secretaries functioned as what we would now call &quot;project managers&quot; -- they made calendars, oversaw who was working on what, followed up to keep track on whether work was being done, and kept a close eye on what money was being spent. The crucial thing about having humans overseeing such work is that humans can take a flexible approach to the rules: they know when to break them. By contrast, systems that are highly dependent on software tend to be more rigid. Software doesn&#x27;t know when its rules should be broken.<p>The flexibility of the old system is constantly underestimated, the rigidness of the new systems is often misunderstood.<p>In his book &quot;The Design Of Design&quot; Fred Brooks talks about the power of trust, and he contrasts that situations where everything needs to be first negotiated and specified in a contract. High trust systems are flexible and fast, whereas a system where every detail needs to be specified in a contract is slow and rigid. We should stop and ask ourselves, our favorite Agile methodology resembles which of these? Are specifying things with needless detail?</td>\n",

News were local + nation wide, people still focused on their physical proximity of 20 miles that affected them the most. Today, none of my friends read local news. Local news outlets are being bankrupted left and right.<p>- Anonymity on the internet. People can say whatever they want without attaching their name, face and self-pride. This creates extremely unproductive conversations without consequences. Platforms such as Twitter propel this behavior to new heights. When it was local, you&#x27;d lose friends for being unpleasant, you&#x27;d lose credibility in your community for being inflammatory.<p>- Foreign interference - when internet use was not widespread, it was difficult to infiltrate a foreign election campaign and interfere with it.<p>- Data collection and manipulation - Targeted newsfeeds that feed these echo chambers could not possibly reach critical mass before the internet. Echo chambers were physical places to go to - Hells Angels or joining the Evangelical Christian church. No such limits exist now.<p>- Scale - The internet allows unprecedented scale to operate on.

This feels to me like it’s going to be great; a big win for consumers and developers.<p>Current A12z chips are highly performant; Apple is roughly one chip cycle ahead on perfomance&#x2F;watt from any other manufacturer. I presume their consumer hardware will launch with an A13Z, or maybe an A14 type chip.<p>Apple has consistently shipped new chip designs on time; Intel’s thrashing has cost them at least two significant update cycles on the macbook line in the last six years. Search this fine site for complaints about how new mac laptops don’t have real performance benefits over old ones —- those complaints are 100% down to being saddled with Intel.<p>Apple has a functional corporate culture that <i>ships</i>; adding complete control of the hardware stack in is going to make for better products, full stop.<p>Apple has to pay Intel and AMD profit margins for their mac systems. They are going to be able to put this margin back into a combination of profit and tech budget as they choose. Early days they are likely to plow all this back into performance, a win for consumers.<p>So, I’m predicting an MBP 13 - 16 range with an extra three hours of battery life+, and 20-30% faster. Alternately a Macbook Air type with 16 hours plus strong 4k performance. You’re not going to want an Intel mac even as of January of 2021, unless you have a very unusual set of requirements.<p>I think they may also start making a real push on the ML side in the next year, which will be <i>very</i> interesting; it’s exciting to imagine what Apple’s fully vertically integrated company could do controlling hardware, OS and ML stack.<p>One interesting question I think is outstanding - from parsing the video carefully, it seems to me that devs are going to want ARM linux virtualized, vs AMD64. I’m not highly conversant with ARM linux, but in my mind I imagine it’s still largely a second class citizen — I wonder if systems developers will get on board, deal with slower &#x2F; higher battery draw intel virtualization, or move on from Apple.<p>Languages like Go with supremely simple cross architecture support might get a boost here. Rust seems behind on ARM, for instance; I bet that will change in the next year or two. I don’t imagine that developing Intel server binaries on an ARM laptop with Rust will be pleasant.</td>\n",

Her point was somewhat limited to drug crimes, but she pointed out that if you look at medical data (where people tend to be fairly honest about their drug usage) pretty much everyone in the metro area under study (SF) used drugs, or at least drug use was equally prevalent in pretty much every geographical area and among all demographics. Therefore, when the cops went to a location to make drug arrests they typically succeeded, because it&#x27;s not hard to find drug crimes in the Bay Area.<p>The problem was that they then used that arrest data to make decisions about where to perform future searches and arrests. Because they found drugs where they had looked previously, they looked there again and found more drugs. This creates a bad feedback loop where they were basically busting the same neighborhoods and demographics over and over again, despite the fact that drug crime was prevalent everywhere. In effect it was an insufficiently explorative learning strategy, just hitting the same lever over and over. Dr. Lum&#x27;s point was that predictive policing software merely hides this dynamic under a layer of black-box ML crap. Because the training data is itself the result of this type of bad policing, the resulting model can only further engrain these practices, it can&#x27;t offer truly novel solutions.<p>Crime and criminology is complicated, but at the end of the day not that complicated. On the whole people commit crime because they are desperate (for money, for drugs, etc.), occasionally because they have an anti-social personality disorder. Applying all these abstract epidemic&#x2F;broken-windows type models which pretend like the root causes of crime are unknowable allows police to appear like they&#x27;re operating efficiently, while at the same time just responding to the symptoms rather than facing the sickness itself. Until we actually look at why crime occurs (mainly because poor people need money badly, secondly because people in sufficiently dire poverty stop caring about the social norms of the middle class) we won&#x27;t be able to make a meaningful difference.</td>\n",

I hope you folks enjoy reading horror stories.<p>I got a job as a Software Engineer in my current company 4.5 years ago; friend-of-a-friend sort of thing. The company had an apparently disastrous piece of software that was their main LOB. They had gone through pretty much every local consulting agency - at least once, on a few occasions they had gone back to one they had already used. It was about 10 years old and consisted of a mix of VB6(!), VB.NET, C#, F# and somehow now Node. At the time tackling a disaster like that sounded fun and I was miserable at a consulting gig. It was a 20k bump but no benefits (health or retirement), but as a single guy 6 months away from paying off his college debt I wasn&#x27;t worried. I figured I&#x27;d dump a few years in then move on.<p>Three months in, I&#x27;m absolutely baffled at what the company does. I was told they handle insurance claims, basically acting as a TPA. (Important detail: I had no idea what a TPA was at the time. It&#x27;s gonna matter later.) The software <i>does</i> handle claims, but they also have 10 other projects that cover a bunch of random business use cases. Apparently the CEO is a self-described &quot;idea man&quot; and would task the previous developer to &#x27;prototype&#x27; his ideas from time to time. The problem was his idea of a prototype was a fully-functional application that he could sell to investors and clients - until he got bored with it and shelved it. This ended up with the company having around a half-dozen actively used products in a half-dozen markets. In addition to the TPA side of the company that was about 50% of revenue, the other half was split over 1) check cashing software, 2) HR&#x2F;onboarding software, 3) some sort if discount medical visit scam, 4) some sort of MLM scam that the CEO&#x27;s brother-in-law co-opted him into, 5) a random cannabis and self-help website run by some yoga guru type dude the CEO knew and finally 6) a piece of software that let helped churches organize events and donations that took about 50% of <i>any</i> transaction that was run through it as &quot;fees&quot; for our company. Now I could talk about any of those monstrosities at length, but this is already shaping up to be a wall so I&#x27;ll skip that.<p>1.5 years later. I&#x27;ve wrangled the mix of VB6, VB.NET, C#, F#, PHP4, PHP5, PERL, ASP.NET WebForms and MVC, SQL Server, Postgres, MySQL still using MyISAM, god knows what other horrors I&#x27;ve forgotten. All of this without version control - just folders copy-pasted over and over on a 10 year old server in the closet that has no redundancy, two failing disks and one PSU out of order. The last guy had started some positive changes: moving everything over to Azure, porting everything related to the claims business into a more modern MVC app. I finished his work. I squashed about a dozen Wordpress instances into a single, multi-tenant host. Squashed out all the other languages and databases into just C#, ASP.NET, SQL Server. Ended up reducing the Azure spend by about $2000 a month. Felt good! CEO loved me. COO (my direct manager) loved me. CFO was pleased. All throughout this, I had convinced the COO to cut out all the shady, near-illegal, morally bankrupt garbage we did. No more check cashing (awful, awful industry), no more MLM of any sort, no more stealing money from churches (we kept that going, just changed our fees to a nominal amount). All the work I had done lead to a decrease in onboarding time from 2-3 days to 10 minutes and the TPA side of things was now about 85% of our revenue. Happy ending, right? Just you wait...<p>Somehow, I had not encountered a single brilliant &quot;CEO Idea&quot; for 1.5 years. He decided to fix that on one delightful summer day in the mid-west by announcing that we would be acquiring a healthcare startup that a buddy of his ran. Now this pissed most of the folks at the company off and is probably a good point to talk a little about the structure of said company. As mentioned, we had a CEO, COO, CFO, and &quot;Chief of Sales&quot; (never heard of a COS myself, but who knows). We didn&#x27;t call ourselves a startup and had none of that Bay-style of startupness; we were just a small business with some investors. After the C&#x27;s we had myself as the lone engineer, two sales guys, three admin-types and six or so customer service folks. None of which had healthcare or retirement benefits, mind you. So there was a bit of rancor when Mr. CEO started talking about dropping $5 mil to acquire this fancy new healthcare company. Somehow me, Mr. Software Engineer, ended up being the guy that needed to take this head-on (well, to be fair, the COO and I had great relationship). That&#x27;s a tale in and of itself, but at the end of the day we ended up getting a 6% matching 401k and $500&#x2F;$1000 single&#x2F;family monthly reimbursement for health insurance, stopped 3-4 people from quitting, got me a whole lot of respect in the office and a fancy new title of &quot;Chief Technical Officer&quot; (not related to the benefits; CEO was just happy at how efficient I&#x27;d made everything) and 20k base salary increase. CTO at a company with 1 engineer. Neat. Happy ending, right? Just you wait...<p>We also got a brand new healthcare startup for about $2.5 mil in cash, $2.5 mil in stock. We got sheisted and it was our fault. While I&#x27;m no MBA, I know what due diligence is, and I intended to do it from the technical angle while our CFO handled it from the financial. Before we bought the company I made every effort to actually review what their software looked like, but was single-handled blocked by my own CEO. &quot;We&#x27;re never going to do that, Throwaway,&quot; he would say, &quot;Other CEO is my friend! I&#x27;ve known him for twenty years and if he says his software is solid, it is! Just trust me.&quot; Diligence took about three months and despite dozens of arguments, I was denied <i>any</i> access to <i>anything</i> technical. All I ever got was: &quot;Our software is in Node using MongoDB and is hosted in the cloud.&quot; Great. I was never even allowed to meet or speak to their development team (apparently 5 engineers, all of which were phenomenal). The only human being I ever spoke to at this company was the CEO. So I tried other angles, the big one being: what the hell does your software actually <i>do</i>? Their big claim to fame was &#x27;modernizing concierge medicine using AI&#x27;. If you&#x27;re like me and have no idea what concierge medicine is, it basically means your doctor comes to you because you&#x27;re a rich yuppie and can&#x27;t be bothered to leave your beach house to visit him. How do you enhance that using AI? I had no idea. Still don&#x27;t. And so we bought the company with zero diligence done, though the CFO did say their books looked good, whatever that means. So the nightmare begins...<p>2 years in. We start onboarding people, I start onboarding the project itself. I am finally given direct developer contacts, which are a bunch of emails that <i>don&#x27;t end in the same domain as the company we just bought?</i> Pardon? They&#x27;re all @BobsRandomConsultingCompany. I reach out, explaining who I am, that we just acquired Project X and I need access to the code, environment, engineers - the whole nine. I get a very lovely, professional response from a Project Manager over at Bob&#x27;s who lets me know that they will be sending over a contract so we can get started right away, along with their rate sheet! I&#x27;m baffled! I thought Project X had 5 internal engineers, Mr. Other CEO?! At this point I promptly aged 6 months in 6 minutes and I felt the first twinge of an ulcer growing.<p>Contract arrives, I sit down with COO and CFO and explain that we have been duped. COO is angry; CFO is not concerned until I show him the contract that Bob&#x27;s sent over. The contract ye olde healthcare startup signed apparently agrees to pay for 5 fixed resources (at $200&#x2F;hr!) for 40 hours of work each, per week, for a <i>period of a year</i>. Now I&#x27;m not unfamiliar with being outsourced as a resource, from a consulting company, for a fixed amount per week - but never have I seen a contract that binds you for a year, especially for 5 resources, with not one deliverable mentioned <i>anywhere</i>. Maybe my five years of consulting wasn&#x27;t enough, but that blew my mind. Additionally, they sent us the server bills (AWS) and informed us we paid directly for utilization in addition to a &quot;HIPAA Monitoring and Compliance Fee&quot; of $3000&#x2F;mo. As I had not a year ago lowered our own cloud costs to about $800&#x2F;mo, this number struck me as staggering. $3000&#x2F;mo base + around $2000 for the servers currently running. Also, &quot;what the <i>fuck</i> is HIPAA&quot; I said aloud, the only answer being the two confused shaking heads of my COO and CFO. Uh-oh...<p>Segway. The actual Project Manager of the acquired company (not the one from Bob&#x27;s Hair Care IT Consulting Nail and Tire Salon) has moved in and I&#x27;ve finally got a victim to victimize with my <i>many, many</i> questions. She already looks harrowed before I begin my interrogation. Are people actually using this? How much do we make per visit? Visits per month? I forget the answers to these, but the end takeaway was: we bring in about $10k&#x2F;mo net right now. I&#x27;m no accountant, but I&#x27;m fairly confident you can&#x27;t pay the expenses of a company + a half dozen employees on $10k&#x2F;mo. PM agrees - they&#x27;ve burnt through about $7 mil of investor cash over their 6 years of existence. No path to profitability is in sight.<p>Around the same time I&#x27;ve got the Project X repository (whew, at least they used source control) moved over into my world and have started reviewing the actual source. I&#x27;m no Node wizard, but I&#x27;m immediately confused as I see both Express and Hapi (two server frameworks, generally considered competition to one another) used in the same project. That&#x27;s...odd. Investigation intensifies: it&#x27;s a simple CRUD project that takes a form submission from a registered user, saves it in Mongo and slaps it into a queue for delivery to the given doctors email. That&#x27;s really it. There&#x27;s some back-end admin that allows the doctor to write some notes about their visit. Like a little baby EMR (though I had no idea what an EMR was at that time). Amusingly, it&#x27;s got an Angular front-end (1.x, because why not spread salt on my wounds) that hits an Express endpoint that then <i>proxies the call to a Hapi endpoint</i>. For no reason. I can&#x27;t find a single comment or piece of documentation explaining why. Icing on the cake? Their is in fact authentication used from Angular -&gt; Express. The Hapi endpoints, however, are wide open - but surely not from the ELB, right? Certainly it&#x27;s just an idiotic architectural decision that isn&#x27;t <i>actually</i> exposed to the public? Nope. There&#x27;s a rule in the ELB. Sweet Baby Ray&#x27;s someone help me, there is a publicly accessible, completely open API that anyone could discover that gives away patient and doctor information. Huh, I wonder if the US has any sort of regulation on that kind of stuff? I should really take some time to investigate that HIPAA thing I found earlier, maybe that&#x27;s got something to do with it...<p>Employment duration: unknown. My ulcer has had a baby. I think I may have had a psychotic break. I Googled HIPAA. I simultaneously shat and pissed myself, which I didn&#x27;t think was possible during a panic attack, but the human body is an amazing thing. I took Thursday and Monday off from work to read through a PDF I found of this most enlightening &quot;HIPAA&quot; legislation. It says &quot;SAMPLE&quot; or &quot;UNOFFICIAL&quot; or some such on it, so I&#x27;m not sure how accurate it is, but whatever - I need to educate myself somehow. I spent a thrilling four days reading, re-reading, and summarizing what I understood of the several hundred page document - printed in three-column layout because why not make it more abysmal. It doesn&#x27;t seem completely dire; it looks like there is some stuff we need to do if we are storing this mythical PHI, but it isn&#x27;t terribly complex (at least technically!). I had already been planning encrypting everything we own, and all of our sites are already behind SSL, so this should be cake. Phew! Calm down, baby-ulcer, don&#x27;t think about grand-kids quite yet. Also I found a few great summaries of the Act which I could share with my COO - but really, we need to sit down with Legal and have them explain why this was never brought up. And let&#x27;s be honest, I&#x27;m not a lawyer - the professionals can handle this!<p>Legal has never heard of HIPAA. That&#x27;s not good. I convince COO to ask Legal to reach out to a different Legal who specializes in healthcare. We sit down with them a few days later and our new Legal turns white after I lay out everything we do, our concerns, and the simple question: &quot;Do we need to do any of this stuff I read about?&quot; Turns out, having your CTO read a complex, many-hundred-pages legal document is <i>not</i> the best way to get accurate legal advice. We&#x27;re fucked. We&#x27;re a TPA filing insurance claims - we absolutely, 100% must comply with this Act. Oh and guess what? The Act has a delightful addition called an Omnibus, passed back in &#x27;13, that makes any possible defense we <i>might</i> have had to not comply...completely null and void. We&#x27;re in what is called &#x27;Breach&#x27;! We have fucked up. Royally and legally. Icing? We&#x27;re all <i>personally</i> liable, at least to the letter of the law.

His life was a complete blank for a while. You&#x27;re not going to be able to get to him.<p>Growing up and living in the D.C. area, I&#x27;m constantly surprised at the paradox of the deeply conservative anti-federal government types who work for the government - directly or as a fed contractor. Who&#x27;ll rattle off about privacy issues before hopping on the bus to their job working on an NSA contract at a Fed contractor...that sort of thing.<p>I&#x27;ve even pointed out point-blank that their salaries are paid for by the same taxes they rail against incessantly and are met with blank stares or wry grimaces before they launch into an extended soliloquy about &quot;values&quot; or personal responsibility or some such. I&#x27;ve even had folks in the military swear up and down that some military benefit program isn&#x27;t a result of tax payer dollars but mysteriously appears out of some kind of pay differential sacrifice they&#x27;ve made instead of working in the private sector.<p>It&#x27;s rather bizarre and I guess to Nakamoto&#x27;s credit, he actually did something about it in a sense.<p><i>edit</i> meta-response to the replies indicating that perhaps his close contact with the government is what motivated him to develop bitcoin, I think that&#x27;s plausible. What we don&#x27;t know is if he developed this philosophy before or after working with the government.<p>I&#x27;m curious though, in the general sense about people who have a fundamentally anti-government philosophy, then take roles supporting and building up the same government they clog their facebook feeds rallying against.</td>\n",

(It might be good for them. But, as my own attorney pointed out, it is generally over-reaching in the requested scope.)<p>The upper management that I have interacted with are a pain in the ass. If it wasn&#x27;t for the CyberTipline, related investigators, and the IT staff, I would have walked away (or minimized my interactions) long ago.<p>Why haven&#x27;t I made my whitepaper about PhotoDNA public?

When I do this I prefer to sleep the 6 to 7 hour range.<p>4. reduce stress: sometimes hard to do but pretty essential for me.<p>5. flux.<p>6. opening your window for sunlight during the day: get vitamin D first thing in the morning.<p>7. buy quality decaffeinated tea: some green tea manufacturers say it&#x27;s decaffeinated but it&#x27;s not really.

I&#x27;m not sure how this is different to much of the chest beating I&#x27;d see on Fox News. I&#x27;m not here to argue for or against the drones. Just that if we pride ourselves on being educated and critical thinkers that we apply that to all sources of data we read.<p>We all know war is hell. We know using weapons to attack people creates horrific, real human harm. So starting off listing the effects of weaponry on humans <i>tells us nothing about drones</i>. It just tells us about the horrors of war. Given this is an article about drones it should be very drone specific. Do drones increase or decrease the inevitable horrors of war? I suspect they decrease it with smaller more targeted bombs vs prior more traditional larger bombs. Today if we make a mistake we bomb the wrong home and kill everyone. 25 years ago we bombed the entire village. Maybe they increase it because we&#x27;re carrying out a lot more sorties than we did prior when a jet and a pilot were needed&#x2F;at risk. However, I&#x27;m not sure and this article goes nowhere close to helping with the discussion.<p>&quot;The view is so pixelated it makes decisions tough&quot; Can you imagine military people who fight&#x2F;fought on the ground in real combat and order in strikes reading that? Surrounded by smoke and fire and deafening noise and hoping (or maybe not caring) that the strike they call in hits the right target&#x2F;s vs all the nearby civilians also hiding and cowering in a village?<p>The military is aware of the impact on these operators. From a February 20013 article sighting a Defense Department study: “Remotely piloted aircraft pilots may stare at the same piece of ground for days,” said Jean Lin Otto, an epidemiologist who was a co-author of the study. “They witness the carnage. Manned aircraft pilots don’t do that. They get out of there as soon as possible.”<p>Lastly, imagine how you&#x27;d feel reading a similar opinion piece on Fox News from a gun ho former operator talking about all the American lives he saved by observing and taking out &quot;the bad guys&quot;. What&#x27;s even better with drones we&#x27;re not losing American solider lives and dramatically reducing the number of innocent civilians killed vs how we would have approached the same problem just 25 years ago.<p>War is hell. The issues are complex. Trusted new sources add to the debate. Biased ones feed their viewership what they know they&#x27;ll eat up and do little, maybe even damage, the search for truth.</td>\n",

Well, I don&#x27;t need to scale in seconds.<p>In my case, my entire monthly bill for the full production environment and a duplicate staging&#x2F;standby environment is constant, simple, predictable, very low compared to what I&#x27;d need to pay AWS, and I still have a lot of performance headroom to grow.<p>One thing worth noting is that I treat physical servers just like virtual ones: everything is managed through ansible and I can recreate everything from scratch. In fact, I do use another &quot;devcloud&quot; environment at Digital Ocean, and that one is spun up using terraform, before being passed on to ansible that does the rest of the setup.</td>\n",

But even at that, the fallacious teleological language he uses about biological evolution by natural selection suggests a way out of this problem. When he says, &quot;Bacteria, like any living organism, want to survive,&quot; and &quot;So anything that we do to try and kill bacteria, or anything the environment does to try and kill bacteria, bacteria will eventually discover ways or find ways around those&quot; he is making factual statements that are plainly incorrect on their face. Bacteria don&#x27;t desire anything, and they don&#x27;t seek out anything or plan anything. Moreover, it is perfectly possible for lineages of bacteria to go completely extinct, and that has undoubtedly happened more times than human beings are aware.<p>Current antiobiotics are themselves mostly derived from &quot;natural&quot; chemicals emitted by microorganisms so that those microorganisms survive natural selection to go on reproducing in a world full of bacteria. Many of the early antiobiotics, for example penicillin, are derived from mycotoxins produced by fungi. Human medicine can use chemicals from fungi for protection against bacteria because human beings and all animals are more closely related to fungi than either fungi or animals are related to bacteria,[1] so fungi have a biochemical similarity to animals that makes it likely (although not certain) that a mycotoxin that is lethal to bacteria will be relatively harmless to human beings.<p>And this is the way forward to developing new antibiotics. As we reach a deeper biochemical understanding of the basis of all life, we will eventually understand the differences, which are biochemical differences at bottom, between human beings and bacteria, between human beings and protists, between human beings and fungi (yes, there are some systematic differences between animals and fungi) and between human beings and all other harmful microorganisms. Only human beings have science labs and clinical research studies to come up with new defenses against the thoughtless, largely immobile threats from other living things. We can form hypotheses, test those hypotheses rigorously, and perhaps make some lineages of harmful microorganisms as extinct in the wild as the smallpox virus and rinderpest virus now are. The intelligence that the hominid lineage has evolved gives human beings advantages that bacteria will never possess.<p>[1] <a href=\"http://ucjeps.berkeley.edu/DeepGreen/NYTimes.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;ucjeps.berkeley.edu&#x2F;DeepGreen&#x2F;NYTimes.html</a><p><a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/1993/04/16/us/animals-and-fungi-evolutionary-tie.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nytimes.com&#x2F;1993&#x2F;04&#x2F;16&#x2F;us&#x2F;animals-and-fungi-evolu...</a></td>\n",

Young daughter is sick and stays home with a babysitter.<p>Everything seems fine until we (the audience) see Alexa on the kitchen counter. Things slowly unravel. The babysitter tries to take the trash out but the doors are locked. The phones stop working. The oven overheats and explodes, spraying lasagna all over the kitchen. Then the daughter sees Alexa. She screams. The babysitter rushes to protect the daughter but a ceiling fan flies off its bearings, knocking the babysitter unconscious.<p>The lights and electrical sockets start to burn out. A fire erupts. Daughter retreats to the foyer, but she&#x27;s trapped. She sits by the front door and whimpers. There&#x27;s no escape. She&#x27;s going to die.<p>Suddenly Father breaks down the door. He smashes Alexa with a baseball bat, then saves his daughter and the babysitter.<p>The family huddles outside while the fire trucks arrive. Neighbors gather and watch the spectacle. Things are going to be okay.<p>A few days later, life starts to return to normal. Mother bakes cookies. She asks her son to measure out three teaspoons of sugar.<p>The doorbell rings. Young daughter answers. Nobody is there. She looks down. There&#x27;s a package. From Amazon . . .</td>\n",

It is the de facto software in its field and is deeply entrenched. Its UX is the most horribly wicked thing I’ve ever come across. We would conduct walkthroughs with process control owners that showed us what they would do in SAP to perform their job functions, and it would take multiple, intelligent people to capture all of the processes. The knowledge that the users at the client had built up was extensive and highly specialized. If something happened to that person, I don’t think you could quickly plug in a new person and have them take over. The initial learning curve felt far too high. I’m sure it gave those people a sense of job security.<p>I feel there is a lot of room to develop better tools that are not so horrid, however, the process for replacing SAP will be long and close to impossible. SAP feels like one of those businesses that’s too big to fail because it’s so entrenched in the corporate world. Somewhat jokingly, I think it would be easier to switch the US over to the metric system. Any challenger will have to be massive, accept losses for over a decade to gain market share, and have incredible support for their clients if they ever want to takeover in the Fortune 500 world. Challenges too great for a mere startup to accomplish.<p>It’s easier to just hire people to learn the SAP workflow and then hire external auditors to make sure the accounting policies are properly being followed.</td>\n",

If you’re vaccinated, your chances of getting severely sick are extremely low. Even among people 65 and older, the combination of the vaccines’ effectiveness and the Omicron variant’s relative mildness means that Covid now appears to present less danger than a normal flu.<p>&gt; For the unvaccinated, however, Covid is worse than any other common virus. It has killed more than 865,000 Americans, the vast majority unvaccinated. In the weeks before vaccines became widely available, Covid was the country’s No. 1 cause of death, above even cancer and heart disease.<p>At this point if an adult in the US is unvaccinated it is (1) almost certainly by choice (there are some people who cannot get it for medical reasons but they make up only a very tiny fraction of the unvaccinated), and (2) it is very unlikely that any evidence or logical arguments will chance their minds.<p>With COVID becoming endemic everyone is going to get antibodies, with the only choice being whether you get your first antibodies by vaccination or by getting COVID.<p>The only question really then is how fast do we want the unvaccinated to do the getting antibodies by getting COVID thing. The faster they get it, the faster we can be as done with COVID as we are ever going to be.<p>I&#x27;d say the answer to that should be determined by the hospital capacity. If a region has sufficient hospital capacity that it would not be overwhelmed by the increase in COVID cases among the unvaccinated go ahead and lift most restrictions.</td>\n",

Or really, what we need is a truly minimal DE. Something that doesn&#x27;t care about GTK or Qt or Kvantum, and stays lean.<p>Edit: I&#x27;ve already tried tiling WMs and I don&#x27;t like them. I want a primarily mouse-driven UI. I&#x27;m sort of in agreement with the NeXT philosophy there. I primarily use Mint and Cinnamon these days.<p>I also understand that applications are bloated, but they can be bloated in their own little sandbox instead of creeping out to the rest of the system.</td>\n",

Why not?  These tools exist for the bigger fish: the dozens of Soviet-era nuclear weapons believed to be missing, or the small amounts of  dangerous pathogens that periodically vanish from research labs.  These are what the government is worried about, and they're not going to risk revealing their methods for something lesser.<p>Warren Buffet has predicted a major nuclear terrorist attack on an American city to be a \"virtual certainty\" given enough time.<p>Ok, but no one here is going to argue that stopping <i>terrorism</i> is bad: the problem is in how we define terrorism.  What happens when the definition becomes progressively wider?  What counts as \"terrorism\" is political, after all.<p>It's important to remember that we still have a functioning democracy.  If you -- Hacker News reader -- decided to run for congress tomorrow, you might not win, but you won't be killed, sabotaged, or secretly blocked.  While some individual politicans may be corrupt, the system broadly is not.  These programs are enforcement mechanisms; the laws themselves are still made by the people, and maybe corporations.  While we as a population may argue about social issues like gay marriage and abortion, our government is not fascist.<p>Further, I take these programs as a great example that security is much harder to create than it is to destroy.  Extreme efforts such as these may still be insufficient to prevent New York from being destroyed by terrorists.  In that case, the acts of a few crazy people still overcame a monumental effort by the entire intelligence apparatus.  What does that say about the time Hacker News is so afraid of, when it's more than only a few crazy people that the government is \"worried about\"?<p>Should these programs exist?  I don't know.  I'm as worried as anyone about the scope creep.  I'm willing to accept a level of inherent danger with living in a free society.  However, do not forget that we can't see NSA success stories.  I might be willing to accept a risk of periodic car bombs, which while tragic are not statistically significant; however, if PRISM is actually effective at tracing and intercepting Soviet nuclear weapons, I can see multiple sides of this issue.<p>We have rights to privacy and protection from unreasonable search and seizure.  Those rights were created to prevent unfair loss of life, liberty, and property.  These programs, hidden in the background, don't inconvenience you, or lead to loss of freedom or property.  Is privacy good?  Of course.  But the incentives the intelligence apparatus have to not use any data collected here against anyone for reasons less than \"real\" terrorism are strong enough, that I think it's not open-and-shut.</td>\n",

While digging around for a solution to that problem, I thought it was odd that no one had built a Adrium&#x2F;Trillian&#x2F;Meebo chat app for modern chat networks. I buried that thought for a while, until I learned about Matrix two years ago.<p>Matrix is the holy grail of chat. It&#x27;s end-to-end encrypted by default, federated and open source. The only problem is that not a single one of my friends or family was on it! Luckily the Matrix folks had already envisioned a solution to this problem - they built an API enabling &#x27;bridges&#x27; between Matrix and other chat networks. This struck a chord with me, maybe we could finally build a single app that I could use to chat with all my friends, regardless of which chat app they used. Through the Matrix community I met Tulir, the most prolific bridge developer and we started working together on what would become Beeper. I&#x27;ve been using it as my primary chat client for almost 2 years now. I could not imagine going back to the hot mess of 12 different chat apps I had before!<p>Beeper is a paid service because I think it aligns interests between us and our users. We make a featureful and secure app, in exchange you pay us money. For those who prefer to self-host, you can run the entire Beeper backend stack on your own server. The vast majority of the code we&#x27;ve written for Beeper is open source on gitlab.com&#x2F;nova. Our desktop client is closed source, but you can use Element (or any open source Matrix client) if you prefer. See our FAQ for more info or I&#x27;d be happy to explain more.</td>\n",

Then you need to start passing options and configuration into your helper method... and before long your helper method is extremely difficult to reason about, because it’s actually handling a dozen cases that are superficially similar but full of important differences in the details.<p>I encourage my devs to follow a rule of thumb: don’t extract repetitive code right away, try and build the feature you’re working on with the duplication in place first. Let the code go through a few evolutions and waves of change. Then one of two things are likely to happen:<p>(1) you find that the code doesn’t look so repetitive anymore,<p>or, (2) you hit a bug where you needed to make the same change to the boilerplate in six places and you missed one.<p>In scenario 1, you can sigh and say “yeah it turned out to be incidental duplication, it’s not bothering me anymore.” In scenario 2, it’s probably time for a careful refactoring to pull out the bits that have proven to be identical (and, importantly, <i>must be</i> identical across all of the instances of the code).</td>\n",

At university I majored in two STEM subjects but also took 10 courses in Philosophy, Art, History, Journalism, and Economics. Almost no one majoring in any of those fields except Econ took more than 2-3 STEM courses, and even then there a dedicated watered down courses to ensure those people could graduate (Algebra instead of Calculus, &quot;Physics for Future Presidents&quot;, etc.).<p>My high school education in the humanities was also far better than my high school education in STEM, which is typical. And the deplorable state of Mathematics education in US high schools acts as a hard constraint toward improving the situation, since you need a baseline of mathematics literacy before proceeding along any other path in STEM.<p>How are journalists supposed to be <i>productively</i> skeptical when the vast majority of them don&#x27;t receive anything remotely approaching a truly well-rounded education?<p>Go read the proximal origins paper. How is a journalist who has never seen a derivative, has never taken BIO 101, and whose Science distribution credit was fulfilled by Physics For Future Presidents supposed to dive into the claims in that paper and critically evaluate the surrounding literature?

But they ride like a bicycle, have gears, a stiff enough frame, luggage racks etc.  There&#x27;s very little compromise.  The fastest I&#x27;ve done on mine is 45 kph and I&#x27;ve ridden 70km in a day. I carry it on and off buses and trains multiple times a day without issue.<p>In the past I had an A-bike[2].  It&#x27;s a fun and cute little design but the wheels are absolutely tiny and has no gears.  You feel like you&#x27;re riding a folding contraption rather than a bicycle. The build quality was rather plasticky too.  I like the idea of an A-shape with telescoping tubes. It&#x27;s quite an ingenious fold.<p>I&#x27;ve also ridden (but not owned) a Pacific CarryMe[3].  The ride experience again suffers for the short wheels and no gears, but it could be useful for some.  The fold still leaves you with quite a long package.<p>I&#x27;d love to try the Kwiggle bike.  I don&#x27;t think the strange seat will cause as many problems as people think, but I suspect the overall ride experience to be a bit bouncy and flexy. Maybe it&#x27;s worth it for the small fold.<p>For a more out-there design I think the Halbrad&#x2F;Half-Bike[4] could be quite nice but it never really got past the prototype stage.

If it were possible to build 20,000 houses in the next 20 years, it would absolutely happen without Google&#x27;s help.<p>The problem with housing there has one simple cause: NIMBYism. SF doesn&#x27;t want to allow taller buildings and denser housing complexes. It&#x27;s vastly worse in the Valley. Towns like Mountain View and Palo Alto ought to be vastly denser, with apartment buildings, duplexes, and other multi-tenant dwellings. The people living there don&#x27;t want that, though, so the laws prohibit it.<p>I don&#x27;t blame people for wanting to keep their quiet neighborhoods and single-unit homes, or low-rises in SF, but until those objections are overcome, the problem is only going to get worse. So while I say that there&#x27;s a simple cause, there&#x27;s no simple solution.<p>The only solution is changing the zoning laws, and that requires changing peoples&#x27; minds.

It&#x27;s unfortunate but it&#x27;s true: you are going to naturally think more about and have better feelings about the coworkers you see every day in person. No, VC doesn&#x27;t count.

The site was an immaculate knock off, with a replay attack in the background. She entered her 2fa code from the app on her phone but the interface rejected the code and asked her for another one. In the background, this 2nd code was actually to authorise the addition of a new &quot;pay anyone&quot; payee, and with that her money was gone[0].<p>I have accounts with 2 banks, one uses SMS 2fa and the other uses an app which generates a token. I had thought that the app was by default a better choice because of the inherent lack of security in SMS as a protcol BUT in the above attack the bank that sends the SMS would have been better because they send a <i>different</i> message when you&#x27;re doing a transfer to a new payee than when you&#x27;re logging in.<p>So really the ideal is not just having an app that generates a token but one that generates a specific type of token depending on what type of transaction you&#x27;re performing and won&#x27;t accept, for example, a login token when adding a new payee. I haven&#x27;t seen any bank with that level of 2fa yet, has anyone else?<p>I guess perhaps passkeys make this obsolete anyway since it establishes a local physical connection to a piece of hardware.<p>[0] Ron Howard voice: &quot;she eventually got it back&quot;</td>\n",

I enjoy watching someone being taken to task in the battle of ideas so to speak, but apparently something about Wolfram just rubs people the wrong way, because they seem to lose the ability to make cogent arguments after reading him. As a simple example of what a healthy discussion could look like: Wolfram didn’t believe black holes were real for the longest time, or at least, had some skepticism about that. One could’ve had a reasonable debate, pointing out where he may have erred (up until he changed his mind). Like a proper scientist does.<p>But vilifying him for wanting to create a research institute is absurd. I have never seen such petty anger at the idea of doing more scientific research.<p>He’s done a fantastic job creating a new model for understanding reality, some of which suggest interesting physical structures underlying our Universe. He’s changed my understanding of evolution completely with his insights on computational irreducibility and complexity.<p>And he’s laying the groundwork for understanding the meta-rules that undergird not just our Universe, but all possible Universes. It’s fantastic stuff.<p>The great Richard Feynman himself frequently collaborated with Wolfram and talked about Rule 30, the foundational insight that spurred Wolfram to create a New Kind of Science. Calling him delusional or a fraud is Wittengtein’s Ruler in action: It says far more about you than it does about him.<p>I always click on a Wolfram thread, and occasionally you do get interesting insights and even informed disagreements, but this is just disgraceful to be honest.<p>There’s true evil in the world. Truly despicable sins. Calibrate your outrage towards that.<p>If you disagree with Wolfram, read his work, steelman it, and show where it’s wrong in a way worthy of scientific skepticism and empiricism.<p>Otherwise you’re worse than what you think he is.</td>\n",

About 3 months ago, I was really annoyed at myself for not knowing how to answer that question so I decided to teach myself.<p>I taught myself everything else I know in programming, so this should be easy, right? NOPE! Apparently everything online about how operating systems and CPUs work is <i>terrible</i>. There are, like, no resources. Everything sucks. So while I was teaching myself I realized, hey, I should make a really good resource myself. So I started taking notes on what I was learning, and ended up with a 60-page Google Doc. And then I started writing.<p>And while I was writing, it turned out that most of the stuff in that giant doc was wrong. And I had to do more research. And I iterated and iterated and iterated and the internet resources continued to be terrible so I needed to make the article better. Then I realized it needed diagrams and drawings, but I didn&#x27;t know how to do art, so I just pulled out Figma and started experimenting. I had a Wacom tablet lying around that I won at some hackathon, so I used that to draw some things.<p>Now, about 3 months later, I have something I&#x27;m really proud of! I&#x27;m happy to finally share the final version of Putting the &quot;You&quot; in CPU, terrible illustrations and all. I built this as part of Hack Club (<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;hackclub.com\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;hackclub.com</a>), which is a community of other high schoolers who love computers.<p>It was cool seeing some (accidental) reception on HN a couple weeks ago while this was still a WIP, I really appreciated the feedback I got. I took some time to substantially clean it up and I&#x27;m finally happy to share with the world myself.<p>The website is a static HTML&#x2F;CSS project, I wrote everything from scratch (I&#x27;m especially proud of the navigation components).<p>I hope you enjoy, and I hope that this becomes a resource that anyone can use to learn!</td>\n",

I hadn’t realized how negative the prevailing sentiment is on Hacker News.<p>One argument seems to be that cryptocurrency is purely speculative, which is apparently a dirty word. What about the stock market? What about any kind of investment? If you truly believe that cryptocurrency is the basis for a superior economic system, isn’t it rational and wise to put some of your savings there?<p>Another argument is that crypto enables ransomware attacks. This to me sounds akin to saying “encryption enables child exploitation”. I.e. it focuses on one abhorrent element of society that would take place no matter what and blames its existence on a system which has great potential for good, a kind of propagandist thinking.<p>Another argument is that Banks will be hurt by crypto. Good! Any epochal transition can be tumultuous, but in my view disrupting the basis of the greatest wealth inequality known to history is a good start. We’re not talking about “banks” that operate on a local or regional basis — these can adapt to using new technology and serve the same people — we’re talking about multinational Banks which went beyond skimming the cream long ago and don’t aparently have people’s best interests in mind.</td>\n",

In my <i>new</i> opinion, they are great for anyone making small projects, and good for disciplined, experienced teams making larger projects, but are really double-edged swords in large projects. If your team really knows what they&#x27;re doing and can take advantage of the flexibility without creating a mess, they can let you move really fast and make elegant DSLs and so on.

I never thought I&#x27;d say this before, but I would have been happier stepping into C++. :-&#x2F;<p>Sure, this is a problem of people, not language.

A viewer&#x27;s ability to distinguish between native ads and regular articles is small and quickly vanishing. If separate ads stop reaching people, the path to monetization remaining is to change your content to reflect someone else&#x27;s agenda.<p>I keep AdBlock off by default because I prefer a world where creators can make a meaningful articles and a useful apps without caring about who they are supporting, and can, as the price tag, separately attach an ad.<p>I do see it as a moral issue.

       "      <td>I have become increasingly convinced Python as a language is a &quot;trap&quot; for any use of notable scale, be the scale about number of developers, codebase size, or performance requirements.  It&#x27;s a great 0-&gt;1 language and great at simple glue, but eventually you hit a wall and have to keep investing larger and larger amounts of people or computing resources to get continued returns... all due to fundamental design decisions in the language from two decades ago that are quite difficult to fix.<p>Unless you go all-in on typing -- which is difficult today with any meaningfully sized existing codebase -- maintenance is largely a &quot;hope manual testing and unit tests catch anything resembling type errors&quot; which is a major challenge for, say, structural change to a code base like refactoring.  Plus typing is still young, the tooling somewhat immature, and can lead to false senses of security if you aren&#x27;t very careful and opt into the strictest modes.  This makes large number of developers and codebase size a major stumbling block.<p>The interpreter performance and GIL are fundamental issues as well.  Multiprocessing and hacks around the GIL are quite painful if you even glance at any native threading code (say in a C++ library) and even when you stick to pure Python, you have a debugging mess when anything goes wrong.<p>But if someone can improve performance, that&#x27;d be great, and has massive impact potential.  It is incremental though and doesn&#x27;t solve fundamental issues with the language.  I&#x27;m also skeptical of the &quot;5x&quot; plan referenced in the blog, and very skeptical we can ever see meaningful removal of the GIL due to library and baked in design decisions in existing code.  This means performance will fall further and further behind compiled languages.<p>(I write all of this having been a part of supporting Python at massive scale for over two decades, including at two FAANG companies who invest heavily in it.  I&#x27;ve seen the curve and the pain it&#x27;s caused, and would never use it for any code that needs to be performant or actively developed on the multi-month or year timescale).</td>\n",

So this isn&#x27;t profiteering, this is the tech not yet being ready price-wise for the mass adoption everyone seems to believe will come soon.

I&#x27;m 10-years removed from these properties so I feel OK talking about them.<p>The sad reality is the Internet publishing is dead and as a business that business is nearly impossible to operate if you have any moral compass. In its place we have various traffic to ad scams and a creator economy built on the backs of a couple large platforms like Twitch, Reddit and YouTube. While the later option seems freeing for some creators, the reality is that soon those too will become hard to make a living from as those large platforms start slowly squeezing their creator class outside of a couple few who play nice. It&#x27;s only slightly better than the journalism field because at least some of the personalities can shoot over to Patreon and work directly with their audience (albeit still tied to another large platforms).<p>I love this space, and it&#x27;s where I grew up as a kid in the late 90s. I love community websites where I can engage with some experts. With video though, it&#x27;s extremely hard to run independently. Hosting video for Giant Bomb in 2008-2012 meant home rolling our own streaming service, chat service and edge-based video platform. We had an all-star engineering team. We had one of the largest podcasts in the world and the hosting bills were killing us. Getting an audience with good content was easy. Monetizing it was very difficult. That&#x27;s only continued over the years as I&#x27;ve seen various companies buy Giant Bomb (CBS, then RV, now Fandom) looking to pick up a premium brand that they could use to mask the giant volume of dead, but trafficked content they had in the background. The shill back then was was to sell Giant Bomb or GameSpot ads, but serve it on GameFaqs or Comic Vine (which had huge traffic at low cost). Various SEO tricks were pulled to hide traffic. For example, Comic Vine moved to a Gamespot subdomain to make this seem more legitimate. I anticipate similar dark patterns every time these sites are resold to cheaper owners. Likely, these brands will be used to promote a mountain of google-driven traffic in other properties.<p>The question I haven&#x27;t been able to solve:<p>How can good content be monetized in a way that allows it to remain independent and not succumb to warping its content to feed that monetization? How can it be audience driven instead? Is such a thing even possible? Right now good monetization strategies beget bad content. There&#x27;s got to be a better way than cobbling together five platforms under a Patreon account, giving all of them 10-50% along the way.</td>\n",

This is how they sustain developers to continue working on Elastic Search. This model has worked for companies long before cloud providers were a thing. What AWS and others basically did is create identical services, keep all the profits, and exploit gaps in Open Source licensing to this end. From the ES perspective, their FOSS contributions were done in good faith which basically boil down to, &quot;If you can run our product on your own, you get it for free&quot;.<p>AWS knows that if they take too much of ES&#x27; market that they won&#x27;t survive. If they don&#x27;t survive it will just be a matter of time before ES is dropped by Amazon and totally unsupported.<p>You can frame this question in terms of ethics, you can frame it in terms of licensing naivety, you can frame it in whatever way you want but Amazon is doing what it always has done: exploiting smaller businesses in its goal to become a conglomerate.<p>Edit: a lot of people talking about the license forget that there&#x27;s an entire spirit to open source. The permissiveness of open source was one thought to be &quot;we can all succeed together&quot; and what people get upset about is the fact that this obviously violates that spirit. The businesses set up to back companies like Elastic Search were setup to sustain the project while continuing to empower it&#x27;s creators to take their vision further. If Amazon takes the pie, that doesn&#x27;t happen. At best, the creators are now Amazon employees and have to follow <i>their</i> desires.

Social scientists did online studies on player behavior and the interactions people had online, on spontaneous self-governance coming into existence, on how communities formed and developed, and many other similar topics. That potential was never fulfilled.<p>Today - some twenty years later - the MMORPG has become a genre of checking off boxes and making numbers go up, along a linear way as laid out by the developers for you. Apart from PvP and maybe some forced grouping, most games would play absolutely identical mechanically, if you were playing all alone on your own private server. You&#x27;d do the same quests, fight the same enemies, get the same loot. All the other players you get to meet online - they don&#x27;t actually influence the game mechanics at all.<p>You play next to each other. Not actually with each other.<p>I&#x27;d like to see a game, where the sum of players (and their interactions) are greater than just the sum of it&#x27;s parts. A game with a virtual economy, a virtual society, etc. - that advance and evolve in a player-driven fashion. A simulated game world that dynamically adapts. Some glimpses of this sort of thing can be seen in games like EvE. Old games (pre-WoW) like UO and SWG had some of that magic as well - but were marred by limitations of the technology of the day. This kind of stuff has evolved very, very little since then.<p>I would assume that with today&#x27;s technology we should be able to get a lot closer to fulfilling that potential.</td>\n",

It became next to impossible to hit a button or anything really, and I just had the time of my life as the teacher scrambled around to figure out what in the hell was going on.<p>I then changed the text file to &quot;cd&quot; and everyone&#x27;s CD drive opened (one after the other as they all slowly picked up the command). It was SO AMAZING (just the choreography of it all), I literally almost shit my pants out of excitement.<p>Problem was, there was only one person in the entire school they felt was capable of such nonsense, so they had me at the principal&#x27;s office an hour later.

It&#x27;s <i>not</i> that I don&#x27;t think diversity in corporate environments is extremely valuable, but it&#x27;s that a Chief Diversity Officer doesn&#x27;t really &quot;own&quot; any sub-organization of the business. That is, the Chief Product Officer owns the product teams, the Chief Technical Officer owns the engineering teams, the Chief Marketing Officer owns the marketing teams. Even the Chief Human Resources Officer, while largely providing support to other teams, still has sizable staff of their own to get their job down. A Chief Diversity Officer&#x27;s job largely comes down to telling other teams how they should change or structure their teams. I have yet to see that approach work.<p>Different teams can certainly work to a common corporate goal, even if that goal isn&#x27;t the primary focus of a particular team. If you really want to ensure that diversity is valued, any initiatives should actually be led by the teams who <i>also</i> do the main &quot;work of the business&quot;, and the goals should be championed by the executives of these teams.<p>So, in the vein of this article, I think independent &quot;ethical AI teams&quot; are a really bad idea. Better to define what ethical AI means at a high leadership level, and if teams need particular experts in these areas they should just hire them as part of that team, not off as a part of some dysfunctional &quot;ombudsman&quot; role.</td>\n",

But refused to publicly endorse this value so that less fortunate children could also benefit from family stability.<p>I’m from a rigidly socially conservative immigrant family that professes fashionably liberal values in public—imposing a double standard between “us” and “Americans.” Meanwhile my wife’s family is from a working class part of the Oregon coast. Watching and hearing about the family instability in these communities is heartbreaking. Half or more of everyone’s parents are divorced. The kids float around seeking stability and the adults can’t provide it.<p>The article is right on the mark talking about the importance of social expectations for men. My family’s rigid expectations have been such a blessing. It made a difference that the way to earn their respect was to get an education and a good job and support my family, and knowing that I would lose that respect if I did anything selfish to destabilize my kids’ lives. The contrast made me realize that professing liberal social values that one doesn’t live by harms society. It matters what we say about what’s good and what’s bad, what works and what doesn’t. Creating a culture where men can attain dignity and social respect by providing for their family and staying with the mother of their kids matters. And creating a culture where men are told it’s okay not to do those things creates harm.<p>This isn’t really a political point though it sounds like one. Social change has swept through America so thoroughly that the head of the “conservative” party is a three-times-divorced man of little character. The social and cultural guard rails have been removed from the whole country. But the impact is obviously felt most damagingly in parts of the country where men need to find dignity in working at the animal feed plant are harder hit by that cultural change than parts of the country where men can find dignity earning half a million dollars a year doing interesting knowledge work.</td>\n",

You write notes in it, save interesting links, and drop in important documents and messages for later. When you need something, ask Journal, and it helps you find it.<p>Eventually, we see it becoming a connected home to gather and share knowledge. You use the best services for issues, documents, messaging and more — and Journal ties them all together. We currently support integrations to Google (Gmail, Calendar, Drive) Slack, Dropbox (Files and Paper), Evernote, Pocket, and Atlassian (Jira and Confluence).<p>We&#x27;re coming out of community beta today, and would love to hear your feedback!<p>If you&#x27;d like an early access code, please reply to this comment.</td>\n",

Furthermore, browser APIs have never embraced the file system because there is still a large group of techies who think the browser should be for browsing documents and not virtualizing apps (spoiler: this argument is dead and nobody will ever go back to native apps again). Finally, the file system paradigm fails with shared content; you can&#x27;t save a Google Doc to disk because then how can your friends or coworkers update it? It&#x27;s much easier for Google to store the data on their server so that everyone can access it instead of you setting up some god-awful FTP-or-whatever solution so that your wife can pull up the grocery list at the store.<p>I&#x27;m hoping the new Chrome file system API will bring a new era of Web apps that respect the file system and allow you to e.g. load and save documents off your disk. However, this still won&#x27;t be good enough for multiplayer apps, where many devices need to access the same content at the same time. I don&#x27;t know if there is any real way we can go back to the P2P paradigm without destroying NAT - WebRTC tries but WebRTC itself resorts to server-based communication (TURN) when STUN fails.</td>\n",

And even though Apple is probably supporting these longer than your average earbuds, after a while the bluetooth version will be obsolete and eventually the battery will have reached its end or inflate and become a safety risk.<p>But because this was expensive and Apple supported it longer, it will have maybe lasted 10 years and one or two (pricey) battery replacements. This is still much worse than audiophile „analog“ headphones and I feel like this change is not adequately addressed.<p>I would really hope to see more approaches like Shure‘s „Aonic 215 True Wireless“ which is an arguably quite ugly attachment to the drivers that have been around for a long while and just adds the wireless capabilities and bluetooth. It can also be used for any other Shure driver afaik. This way you keep the good old sound producing piece while swapping out the stuff that will degrade over time.</td>\n",

It seems that every company&#x2F;&#x2F;startup has to use slack nowadays to pretend to be cool again.<p>Everytime I have a serious conversation about the productivity gains or losses of Slack though, it is pretty clear to me that it is more disruptive than helpful. It fosters a &quot;Always on&quot; culture, where irrelevant chats are exchanged publicly to advertise how much work is being done. If you shut down Slack and appear as Offline people assume you are not working.<p>It also seems to me that now that Slack became the norm for communication, I almost don&#x27;t receive well written emails with well-argued technical discussions anymore. Everything is now a &quot;Chat&quot; that dilutes the technical discussion because it needs to be responded &quot;directly&quot;.<p>I would expect 2018 to be the year where people start questioning the utility of &quot;Slack everywhere&quot; and not blindly jump on the Slack bandwagon because that&#x27;s what great startups do.</td>\n",

I am 100% blind, and guess what, I prefer the term blind because it is pretty descriptive and relatively short.  But all of a sudden, people external to the community started to fumble around with &quot;visually challenged&quot;, and all the nonsense variations of that in my native language.  It is so weird, because it adds yet another layer of distance between &quot;us&quot; and the &quot;normal&quot; people.  You can almost feel how the stumbling-word is making communication even more awkward.  I (and almost all of my friends with a similar disability) make a point of letting people know that we actually prefer the word blind over everything else, and not even that does put people at ease.\\nIt sounds a bit provocative, but it feels like that: The language terror they were subjected to has made them so unsecure that they actually dont want to hear that blind people have no issue with being called blind.  They somehow continue to argue, sometimes not wanting to accept that and going on to use weird language.<p>Its a weird phenomenon.  The longer I watch all of this, and I also mean the gender-language-hacks, I feel like this move has added to the distance between various groups, not made it smaller.<p>It is so condescending to believe your own language-police more then the person you are talking to.

No matter what operating system you&#x27;re on, you&#x27;ll eventually run into an application that doesn&#x27;t render in high dpi mode. Depending on the OS that can mean it renders tiny, or that the whole things is super ugly and pixelated (WAY worse than on a native 1080p display)<p>2. If the 4k screen is on your laptop, good luck ever having a decent experience plugging in a 1080p monitor. Also good luck having anyone&#x27;s random spare monitor be 4k.<p>3. Configuring my preferred linux environment to work with 4k is either impossible or just super time consuming. I use i3 and it adds way more productivity to my workflow than &quot;My fonts are almost imperceptively sharper&quot; ever could<p>My setup is 2x24&quot; 1920x1200 monitors - so I get slightly more vertical pixels than true 1080p, but in the form of screen real estate rather than improved density. I also have 20&#x2F;20 vision as of the last time I was tested.<p>My argument in favor of 1080p is that I find text to just be... completely readable. At various sizes, in various fonts, whatever syntax highlighting colors you want to use. Can you see the pixels in the font on my 24&quot; 1080p monitor if you put your face 3&quot; from the screen? Absolutely. Do I notice them day to day? Absolutely not.<p>I genuinely think 4k provides no real benefit to me as a developer unless the screen is 27&quot; or higher, because increased pixel density just isn&#x27;t required. If more pixels meant slightly higher density but also came with more usable screen real estate, that&#x27;d be what made the difference for me.</td>\n",

It was so remarkable because he actually took the time.<p>Edit 2: There seems to be some debate on the meaning of &quot;mean&quot;.

Uber is significantly (years) behind Waymo in the SDC space.<p>3. Waymo will launch SDC taxi services first meaning:<p>- When it puts in an order for SDC components no one else is going to be buying in bulk and thus it can have effectively 100% of capacity of these specialized equipment makers<p>- It is going to be competing with other taxi&#x2F;ride share services with all the cost advantages of SDC vehicles while its competitors are paying human drivers (and have basically no fat to cut from their current pricing)<p>- It will be able to improve its services so when someone else does launch their service will be inferior.<p>4. Uber expects that its users will stick to it over the course of years in the face of significantly cheaper competition.<p>5. Uber expects that it is going to be able to continue to use human drivers even while it competes against those same people with its SDC&#x27;s (i.e. when your employer hires your replacement but expects you to train them).<p>I simply can&#x27;t imagine how Uber is worth anything at the moment.</td>\n",

They are pretty clear that 1.5 Pro is better than GPT-4 in general, and therefore we have a new LLM-as-judge leader, which is pretty interesting.<p>5. It seems like 1.5 Ultra is going to be highly capable. 1.5 Pro is already very very capable. They are running up against very high scores on many tests, and took a minute to call out some tests where they scored badly as mostly returning false negatives.<p>Upshot, 1.5 Pro looks like it <i>should</i> set the bar for a bunch of workflow tasks, if we can ever get our hands on it. I&#x27;ve found 1.0 Ultra to be very capable, if a bit slow.

Write a new module that does X&quot;.<p>I really want to know how they&#x27;re getting to 10M context, though. There are some intriguing clues in their results that this isn&#x27;t just a single ultra-long vector; for instance, their audio and video &quot;needle&quot; tests, which just include inserting an image that says &quot;the magic word is: xxx&quot;, or an audio clip that says the same thing, have perfect recall across up to 10M tokens. The text insertion occasionally fails.

When there&#x27;s a well-defined task and little ambiguity, remote workers can usually complete it faster than in-office workers.  But when the task is highly ambiguous, requires many course corrections, involves rapid communication, or relies on a large degree of trust, the in-office teams end up more productive.  It all stems from known research on the benefits &amp; detriments of office work, i.e. offices build trust and allow higher-bandwidth communication, but they also have more distractions and a less comfortable work environment.<p>I think the trigger that would bring people back to the office is a new economic boom based on new and unknown technology.  That creates a highly ambiguous environment where you&#x27;re forging ahead in unknown directions and need a lot of trust in leadership to make progress at all.

If prices for goods are staying the same then it may not be that their value has not changed, they may be less valuable goods, but they cost the same because you&#x27;re also buying them with less valuable currency.<p>If you have gone through years of moving everything to China to make it cheaper to manufacture, improved technology to make processes more efficient, etc. and I&#x27;m still paying the same amount for all of the stuff in my life, then again, maybe all these things are cheaper, but I&#x27;m also buying them with currency that&#x27;s less valuable.<p>Ultimately, printing money doesn&#x27;t make anyone more productive or produce anything. All it does is redistribute wealth from those that were first to get the new free money away from those that were last to contact it.</td>\n",

I don’t know how the original poster’s machine was set-up, but I’m gonna throw out a few theories about what could be happening.<p>If similar code is open in your VS Code project, Copilot can draw context from those adjacent files. This can make it appear that the public model was trained on your private code, when in fact the context is drawn from local files. For example, this is how Copilot includes variable and method names relevant to your project in suggestions.<p>It’s also possible that your code – or very similar code – appears many times over in public repositories. While Copilot doesn’t suggest code from specific repositories, it does repeat patterns. The OpenAI codex model (from which Copilot is derived) works a lot like a translation tool. When you use Google to translate from English to Spanish, it’s not like the service has ever seen that particular sentence before. Instead, the translation service understands language patterns (i.e. syntax, semantics, common phrases). In the same way, Copilot translates from English to Python, Rust, JavaScript, etc. The model learns language patterns based on vast amounts of public data. Especially when a code fragment appears hundreds or thousands of times, the model can interpret it as a pattern. We’ve found this happens in &lt;1% of suggestions. To ensure every suggestion is unique, Copilot offers a filter to block suggestions &gt;150 characters that match public data. If you’re not already using the filter, I recommend turning it on by visiting the Copilot tab in user settings.<p>This is a new area of development, and we’re all learning. I’m personally spending a lot of time chatting with developers, copyright experts, and community stakeholders to understand the most responsible way to leverage LLMs. My biggest take-away: LLM maintainers (like GitHub) must transparently discuss the way models are built and implemented. There’s a lot of reverse-engineering happening in the community which leads to skepticism and the occasional misunderstanding. We’ll be working to improve on that front with more blog posts from our engineers and data scientists over the coming months.</td>\n",

That act of organization likely implies that the Java API (taken as a whole) constitutes a copyrightable work, even if the individual method signatures are not.<p>What&#x27;s worse for Google is that code has always been considered copyrightable so arguing that APIs are non-copyrightable is essentially carving out an exception for a specific type of code.<p>As is common when HN discusses legal matters I see a lot of people blaming the judges for not understanding tech, but the problem here isn&#x27;t really the judges so much as the law itself.

I think we need tools &amp; interfaces to better (more holistically) accommodate people’s intellectual workflows; what we have today is geared much more towards consumption.<p>As an example: why can’t we easily group tabs into projects and have <i>bidirectional sync</i> between the browser and project related resources (Eg: Some markdown&#x2F;org file, or sync with Evernote&#x2F;Notion&#x2F;Roam, etc) so that whenever I resume working on the project, I get a warm start with the context mapped out (continuing from the previous session). And I want a much tighter relationship between my tabs and my project notes (akin to bibliography of references), including annotations on webpages, etc. If we are to use the web more effectively, the ecosystem surrounding browsers needs to grow up and help us get there.</td>\n",

Where does the extra energy, if the ship falls into a heavier planet, come from?<p>It seems that the energy is being stored somewhere, and that matter itself allows us to tap into that, but is not the place where it is stored.

So the amount of pure thinking you can do without writing anything at all is extremely limited.<p>My solution to this problem is to actually hit the keyboard almost immediately once I have one or more possible ways to go about a problem, without first fully developing them into a well specified design. And then, I try as many of those as I think necessary, by actually writing the code. With experience, I&#x27;ve found that many times, what I initially thought would be the best solution turned out to be much worse than what was initially a less promising one. Nothing makes problems more apparent than concrete, running code.<p>In other words, I think that rather than just thinking, you need to put your ideas to the test by actually materializing them into code. And only then you can truly appreciate all consequences your ideas have on the final code.<p>This is not an original idea, of course, I think it&#x27;s just another way of describing the idea of software prototyping, or the idea that you should &quot;throw away&quot; your first iteration.<p>In yet different words: writing code should be actually seen as part of the &quot;thinking process&quot;.</td>\n",

To detect a rogue AirTag, an Android owner needs to:<p>1) know AirTags exist (many obviously don&#x27;t)<p>2) go out of their way to install Apple&#x27;s Android AirTag scanner app (only 100k-500k worldwide have done so according to Google Play stats)<p>3) manually open the scanner app and scan, since it doesn&#x27;t scan passively in the background; and even then, it won&#x27;t help you find the speaker-less AirTag, since it doesn&#x27;t tell you proximity &amp; direction.<p>I continue to think Apple should have never released AirTags to the public, and should discontinue it. It&#x27;s a very limited income stream, with limited use cases, and significantly increases the average person&#x27;s risk of stalking.<p>Practically all positive social media coverage of AirTags involves someone tracking a stolen stolen items (car, bike). Those use cases are dead, since thieves with iPhones will get alerts, and most thieves with Android will know to scan for AirTags. And since most lost items turn into stolen items after a few hours, that removes most use cases involving losing objects in public.<p>That leaves &quot;finding your keys within your home&quot; as the only truly &quot;officially supported&quot; use case. Is that worth all the problems, and brand damage?<p>People will argue that stalkers could always buy trackers, but Apple increased their availability, ease-of-acquisition and ease-of-use by orders of magnitude. AirTags are cheaper than competing GPS trackers, most of which require subscriptions.<p>I remember seeing a chills-down-your-spine Apple Watch Series 7 TV ad, that featured beautiful remote nature landscapes, with the audio of 911 calls made from people&#x27;s Apple Watches whose lives were saved by their Watch. Probably one of Apple&#x27;s best and most impactful ad in the past decade. Compare that to AirTag&#x27;s impact on Apple&#x27;s brand. Why did Apple even bother?</td>\n",

It&#x27;s one of those things that may feel overly burdensome in the short term, but is better in the long term. I say this as someone who taught programming with beginners, and observed what many of them will do when given an IDE, which at the scale of the code they&#x27;re writing, makes the time-to-iterate <i>very</i> short (press a key and you instantly see your changes). They end up getting into a &quot;dopamine feedback loop&quot; that causes them to continually make tiny changes and rebuild&#x2F;run, and the code written as a result of this looks exactly like what you&#x27;d expect: it barely works, and is full of redundancies, &quot;dead ends&quot;, and other evidence that its author was probably not thinking of anything more than the next line or two when writing it.<p>In other words, reducing the iteration time reduces the motivation to get it right the first time, and the associated deep reasoning&#x2F;&quot;mental execution&quot; skills which are required to do so. In order to develop those skills, one should strive to write as much code as possible before running it, and a high iteration time assists with that.<p>Also, I&#x27;m tempted to continue the title with &quot;...unless it&#x27;s APL&quot;.</td>\n",

In other words, the trip is the point, not the mechanistic neuro-tinkering [0].<p>Importantly, this tracks with what we know about the protective effects of things like religiosity against depression.  As such, the qualitative experience of the drug might not be something we can (or should) do away with.  I would even go as far as suggesting that an absence of transcendence in one&#x27;s life is precisely what <i>causes</i> a large segment of people to become depressed in the first place, and that perhaps drugs are helpful only insofar as they produce a transcendent experience.<p>This isn&#x27;t to say we can&#x27;t take a scientific approach to treating depression, but that has to be balanced with something profoundly metaphysical:  the actual qualia of life experience.  Wellness isn&#x27;t the absence of disease; it&#x27;s the presence of thriving, and that includes within it a component of things like hope, inspiration, and elevation above the ordinary.  We used to have various ceremonies designed to turn us towards the numinous, but we&#x27;ve pretty systematically dismantled those in favor of a grounded hyper-rationality [1].  As a scientist, I can&#x27;t really object to rationality on its own, but it may be worth considering non-rational, transcendent experience as a fundamental psychological need.<p>[0] If you&#x27;re a materialist, you might object that neurological machinery is not differentiable from qualia.  Fair enough!  I even agree!  My point is simply that medicine needs to consider qualia as a <i>major</i> parameter in the treatment of depression.  Fixing depression is not like fixing a car.<p>[1] I suspect most people here are familiar with Nietzsche&#x27;s &quot;God is dead quote&quot;.  Many people in my entourage are floored to discover that he correctly predicted the dramatic increase in anxiety, depression, neuroticism and nihilism that is present in modern life.</td>\n",

The curious, although ultimately predictable, outcome of the new rent control measure in Oregon is that while I have historically had an arrangement with my property management to be restrained in annual rent increases, they are now advising a default annual increase of the maximum allowed (7 percent before inflation).  This is because larger adjustments cannot be made if and when necessary due to market conditions, so it&#x27;s smart to just steadily increase rent at the maximum rate permitted.  If I agree, I believe the result will be more profitable for landlords, and hurtful to tenants.<p>The real solution to a housing problem is to incentivize and facilitate the building of more housing.

Apple can&#x27;t decrypt the vector contents, or response contents. Only the client can decrypt the result of the lookup.<p>This is what a good privacy story looks like.

There are other tools to provide privacy (DP, homomorphic encryption), while also using services. They are immensely complicated, and user&#x27;s can&#x27;t realistically evaluate risk.

I believe the EU followed suite recently.<p>Edit: After doing more research based on many comments here, I realized I was wrong. The brand Teflon replaced PFOA with GenX, a different fluorosurfactant that&#x27;s probably worse than PFOA. From what I can tell, fluorosurfactants are more or less required to make PTFE and it seems quite likely that all fluorosurfactants are toxic.

That feels like a decent trade off to me comparing years of life lost from liver cancer to time spent scraping scrambled eggs off of pans.<p>I want to add that a lot of cool startups are working on PFAS remediation.

We reduce distribution of posts that use divisive and polarizing tactics like clickbait, engagement bait, and we’ve become more restrictive when it comes to the types of Groups we recommend to people.<p>We come to these decisions through rigorous debate where we look at all angles of how our decisions will affect people in different parts of the world - from those with millions of followers to regular people who might not otherwise have a place to be heard.

We are so amazed by its ability to babble in a confident manner that we are asking it to do things that it should not be asked to do. GPT is basically the language portion of your brain. The language portion of your brain does not do logic. It does not do analyses. But if you built something very like it and asked it to try, it might give it a good go.<p>In its current state, you really shouldn&#x27;t <i>rely</i> on it for anything. But people will, and as the complement of the Wile E. Coyote effect, I think we&#x27;re going to see a lot of people not realize they&#x27;ve run off the cliff, crashed into several rocks on the way down, and have burst into flames, until after they do it several dozen times. Only then will they look back to realize what a cockup they&#x27;ve made depending on these GPT-line AIs.<p>To put it in code assistant terms, I expect people to be increasingly amazed at how well they seem to be coding, until you put the results together at scale and realize that while it kinda, sorta works, it is a new type of never-before-seen crap code that nobody can or will be able to debug short of throwing it away and starting over.<p>This is not because GPT is broken. It is because what it is is not correctly related to what we are asking it to do.<p>2. My second conclusion is that this hype train is going to crash and sour people quite badly on &quot;AI&quot;, because of the pervasive belief I have seen even here on HN that this GPT line of AIs <i>is</i> AI. Many people believe that this is the beginning and the end of AI, that anything true of interacting with GPT is true of AIs in general, etc.<p>So people are going to be even more blindsided when someone develops an AI that uses GPT as its language comprehension <i>component</i>, but does this higher level stuff that we <i>actually</i> want sitting on top of it. Because in my opinion, it&#x27;s pretty clear that GPT is producing an <i>amazing</i> level of comprehension of what a series of words means. The problem is, that&#x27;s <i>all</i> it is really doing. This accomplishment should not be understated. It just happen to be the fact that we&#x27;re basically abusing it in its current form.<p>What it&#x27;s going to do as a <i>part</i> of an AI, rather than the whole thing, is going to be amazing. This is certainly one of the hard problems of building a &quot;real AI&quot; that is, at least to a first approximation, solved. Holy crap, what times we live in.<p>But we do not have this AI yet, even though we think we do.</td>\n",

The Mexican military has fewer people than the cartels and have a smaller budget.  According to this article from 2012 (<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;muse.jhu.edu&#x2F;article&#x2F;485071\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;muse.jhu.edu&#x2F;article&#x2F;485071</a>) the Mexican cartels employ 450,000 people and make $25 billion annually (these numbers have probably increased in the last eight years).  The Mexican military would have to be incredibly skilled to take them on with 177,000 people and a $7 billion budget.  And even then, that&#x27;s just the Mexican cartels, there are more in South America and the rest of the world.  Stopping the illegal drug trade would take a unified policy effort from every government in the world, we&#x27;re past the point of being able to be able to fight the cartels with military power.</td>\n",

I think that cryptocurrency enthusiasts are seriously underestimating the importance of double-spending attacks to the economics of bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies.<p>A few points that convinced me not to put my money into this system:<p>If hash capacity were traded on a perfectly competitive market, then it would always make sense to rent 51% of the capacity at market rates, earn the transaction fees, and also perform a double-spending attack. There is no equilibrium point for transaction fees where this attack becomes uneconomical. The only defense is that the market for hash capacity is imperfect.<p>The market for hash capacity is going to become more efficient over time. ASIC miners will be commoditized, so that hardware investment becomes a much smaller factor in hash cost versus energy. This might be even worse during a bitcoin downturn, because there could be a glut of ASIC miners.<p>Miners will coordinate with market prices, turning off capacity when the price dips (for example, because someone is underbidding to create a 51% attack). If mining becomes more decentralized, it will be harder for miners to act in their common interest (fending off 51% attacks) and against their immediate interest (selling their hashrate to the highest bidder, or taking it off the market during an underbidding attack).<p>High transaction volume is not necessarily any help - the more transaction volume, the higher the cost of the attack, but the greater the rewards. The semi-anonymous nature of bitcoin means that one could easily flood the network with double-spend transactions. Attacking a huge network like bitcoin would be an audacious and expensive act, but there are certainly organizations with the resources to do it, e.g. intelligence agencies, organized crime. The massive rewards to such an attack also offset fixed costs such as writing and testing the software to carry out the attack.</td>\n",

As a result they flash one time during the positive phase and one time during the negative phase of the 60 Hz A&#x2F;C mains frequency.<p>I find this unacceptable. Although not too noticeable in normal conditions, a 120 Hz strobing light is definitely noticeable when your eyes move or track an object illuminated by the bulb.<p>In my experience, Philips lightbulbs are one of the few brands that don&#x27;t have this flaw because they take care of converting AC to a stable DC voltage internally.

Fireworks was cheap, powerful, and hugely ahead of its time. Many of the features and flows people love in Figma and Sketch were pioneered years earlier in Fireworks.<p>After the acquisition, Adobe starved Fireworks of resources and marketing. They broke things, left major bugs and performance regressions unfixed, and eventually discontinued it altogether. I&#x27;d argue this wasn&#x27;t simply negligence, but a calculated decision to kill an innovative product because it threatened the profits of their cash cows.<p>As much as I hope otherwise, I believe the acquisition of Figma will go the same way.

Just the cooling system is more expensive than alternatives.<p>And this is a trend we will see in the future. For primary generation of electrons, steam based thermodynamic cycles are pretty much obsolete. The number I typically hear is that it&#x27;s $1-2W to build, say, a cooling system for coal steam. A nuclear plants cooling is pretty much identical. Solar and wind are going to undercut that cost very soon.<p>So the name of the game is now storage. Attaching four hours of storage to a solar generation farm, just enough to get through the duck curve, is now slightly cheaper than coal.<p>The best estimate of what the cheapest possible future grid looks like is: solar&#x2F;wind capacity at 4x of total demand (thermal generators are roughly at 2x on the current grid), with 3-4 days of storage. This translates to world with abundant energy, at certain times, that&#x27;s generated at zero marginal cost.  There are still lots of transmission costs however.

Postage was 5¢ and had only increased 5 times in the previous 100 years.<p>You might retort that average household income is $70000 now vs $6200 in the early 60s– a tremendous boon. Remember in 1963 only the man was working, and typically supported 4 kids, a wife and often parents in the home.<p>In other words you had 1 man working 50 hours a week afford a house and support 5-6 other people.  Today you have 2 people working 100 hours a week to support 1-2 additional people , while living in an apartment and living in a run down and crime infested neighborhood.<p>In case you think this is academic, look at the occupations for those who lived in today’s wealthiest neighborhoods.  Today Palo Alto, Menlo Park, and other super zips are exclusively $500k incomes and up.  In the 1960 census records you will find these good neighborhoods occupied with plumbers, painters and other blue collar workers.<p>My point is that inflation isn’t abstract and it isn’t a law of nature. It’s a deliberate approach to stealing your prosperity while you cheer it on.<p>Summers is right more than he’s wrong.  Real inflation has always been higher than the bogus CPI numbers, and the past 5 years it’s been accelerating.</td>\n",

Adjusted for inflation the median cost per square foot of new housing is almost exactly the same as it was in 1990. (This doesn&#x27;t even take into account that mortgage rates are drastically lower since then.)<p>We get skewed on this for two reasons. One is because homes today are substantially larger and have more amenities than they did in previous generations. We take for granted better fire safety, higher ceilings, central A&#x2F;C, higher load electrical circuits, attached garages, better lighting, and swimming pools that are much more common in new construction.<p>Two is that we&#x27;re highly skewed to a handful of elite metros, whose housing markets are not representative of the country as a whole. Housing is expensive in San Francisco, New York, LA, and DC. But in places like Tampa, Omaha, Cincinnati, and Phoenix the cost of housing (per square foot) has barely gone up at all.<p>The demand for ultra-expensive housing in places like the Bay Area is driven by the huge earning potential of the high-skilled labor market. (Of course the supply side of the equation is driven by NIMBY zealotry.) If you&#x27;re talented enough to make it as an L8 at Google, then it probably does make sense to buy a house in Palo Alto.

They nearly never need to orient a product to scan it. Their scan speed is far faster than any other supermarket I&#x27;ve been at.<p>-if two products are very similar, they&#x27;ll change the packaging in an obvious way. Blueberry and blackberry yogurt typically look very similar, but the lids are obviously dark and light purple at Aldi. They can glance down and count how many of each, scan one, then hit the number pad for the quantity. I haven&#x27;t seen the number pad used extensively at any other grocer.<p>-they combine varieties (like flavors of granola bars) of product in the same box. This greatly reduces the shelf space required.<p>-depositing a quarter for a cart eliminates the need to pay people to collect carts<p>-they keep product the box from the manufacturer. This eliminates labor from unboxing and facing product.<p>-they don&#x27;t have plastic bags. You can grab boxes (normally a waste stream) and take them home with you.<p>-they don&#x27;t list a phone number for their stores. With as few as 2 people on site during the slow times, they can&#x27;t afford to have anyone on the phone.<p>-their conveyor belt is far longer than most stores. You should be able to get your entire cart worth of groceries on the conveyor at once. This minimizes the slowness of people handing one item at a time to the next checker.<p>-They&#x27;re big on turning inventory over. If they trial a product and it doesn&#x27;t sell well enough, they have no problem simply not carrying it anymore. You can&#x27;t always get everything set Aldi, but you can get 85-95% of items you need there.<p>-they wanted to avoid vendor lock-in, so they had two POS vendors develop solutions simultaneously, awarding the contract to the one which provided the best solution.</td>\n",

When you talked about unions, people would think about the Teamsters, the police unions, etc.<p>Myself and others would end up pointing out that yes, that&#x27;s true of some blur collar unions, but that&#x27;s not what we&#x27;re talking about. Think about the Writers Guild, or SAG. Dwayne Johnson earned $90 million last year - he still pays his union dues. You&#x27;d struggle to find any writer who didn&#x27;t think the Writers Guild had actively improved their working conditions.<p>Are the various Hollywood unions perfect? No, they&#x27;re not. But I think you would really struggle to argue that working conditions would be better for those in the creative arts without them.<p>Tech companies have spent a long time cultivating an image of benevolence towards their employees, but ultimately they are not your friends. You need somebody to fight your corner. Hollywood found this out years ago with the studios - hopefully Silicon Valley will discover it too, however unlikely it seems.</td>\n",

How else could you explain just how far they seem to have drifted away from basic reality?<p>First of all, David: The word is VALUATION, not evaluation. KTHX.<p>Secondly, EVERY SINGLE COMPANY IN THE WORLD that has shares that trade is valued by taking the last share traded and multiplying by the number of shares outstanding. It's just the DEFINITION of valuation. It's TAUTOLOGICAL.<p>The whole section \"Minority investment evaluations aren’t real\" is so economically bizarre and incorrect that I don't even know where to start. It's like you wrote a blog post arguing that it is incorrect to refer to a 5' tall boy as 5' tall because he's often sitting down. Every single day every single public company in the world is valued by the last share traded, usually for a tiny fraction of the company.<p>Finally, to the main point. Facebook has certainly figured out how to make money off of 500,000,000 users. And as they optimize, they will make a lot more money. When they figure out how to make another DIME off of every user, they will instantly be making another $50,000,000 a year... in pure profit. How much profit will 37signals make if you figure out how to make another dime off of every customer? Eh David? Facebook works on the theory that when you have a lot of people, you don't have to make as much per person, because the amount of money you make is the number of customers times the amount of money you make off of each one.

The shock for me was how the hell a giant clothing company (H&amp;M if I recall correctly) has such an underground song on.<p>So I started googleing around to find out how music in stores gets selected, and long story short, this is a multi-million dollar business and there are companies which create playlists according to your brand. These companies also scour the world for underground artists, because you want your store to have the best music before it&#x27;s popular, so that customers perceive you as a trendsetter.<p>What is the success metric for these playlist companies? One of the task of store employees is to report how many customers they notice using Shazam in the store.</td>\n",

Thanks everyone for doing the author&#x27;s work for them and gathering more data. I won&#x27;t be upset if it&#x27;s proven that crypto is intrinsically bad for everything I love - except insofar as I believe it can&#x27;t be stopped.)<p>1. There is no comparison made to the energy consumption of the traditional banking industry, which I am sure is not a <i>particularly</i> energy-efficient industry.<p>2. The title of the article is itself editorializing the content of the article and is <i>speculative</i> according to their own words. From TFA: &quot;[The EIA] released a study suggesting that cryptocurrency mining represents up to 2.3% of U.S. power demand.&quot; It could be less, much less, or <i>much</i> less, although I haven&#x27;t read the actual report yet (I&#x27;m criticizing this article only), because &quot;suggesting&quot; could be doing a lot of heavy lifting<p>3. &quot;Just 137&quot; isn&#x27;t meaningful AFAIK. Who cares if it&#x27;s 100 or 10 or 10,000 miners? The point is the <i>amount of crypto</i> being mined. (The number of miners will always be in flux by design anyway.) And the answer to that, from TFA: &quot;The EIA found that the global share of Bitcoin mining that takes place in the U.S. grew from 3.4% in 2020 to a whopping 37.8% in 2022.&quot; So roughly ~2% of US power is generating over 1&#x2F;3 of the world&#x27;s Bitcoin. This is only <i>obviously bad</i> if you believe Bitcoin is a <i>total waste</i> of energy, which I don&#x27;t, but I understand that some do.<p>4. Energy consumption is frankly not a phenomenon I give two shits about, as an environmentalist. Fossil fuel consumption is. From TFA: &quot;We intend to ... quantify the sources of electricity used to meet cryptocurrency mining demand.&quot; Meaning this has not been done, and publishing scary warnings is premature. If Bitcoin mining ends up using a higher proportion of renewable energy than, say, traditional banking, it could be seen as a net good for crypto use to rise.</td>\n",

Email is itself archaic, and there aren&#x27;t good reasons people should use it for routine peer-to-peer communications that need secrecy.<p>Why? Because:<p>* It&#x27;s default-plaintext. We don&#x27;t generally love the way websites ensure they&#x27;re viewed securely, but email doesn&#x27;t even have the basic mechanisms HTTP has to prevent secrets from accidentally being sent in the clear.<p>* Email encryption is never forward-secure. The most popular standard, OpenPGP, involves a long-term key that is the root of secrecy for all messages from a particular person. Lose that key, ever, and not only is every message you send in the future unsafe, but every message you&#x27;ve ever sent in the past is too. That&#x27;s a terrible property for a secure messaging system.<p>* Email leaks metadata. In fact, some of what we call email &quot;metadata&quot; isn&#x27;t even metadata --- stuff like subject lines are simply content. They&#x27;re sent in plaintext. We would never accept a new secure messaging system that behaved like that.<p>* Most email users get their email from a website. Unless you make them install something on all their computers --- and at that point, just get them to install Signal, WhatsApp, or Wire --- &quot;encrypting&quot; their email involves schemes in which those websites can get their plaintext mail.<p>* Most email clients are searchable-archive-by-default. Again, if you&#x27;re using a secure messaging system to keep secrets from a state-level adversary, that&#x27;s exactly what you don&#x27;t want. And again, what matters here is the behavior of the overwhelming majority of clients. If you can stipulate a special mail client that is extra-careful, why not stipulate a forward-secure advanced messaging system and stop bothering with email?<p>Everything that makes email effective in the real world makes it inhospitable to secure messaging. We should stop trying to push this particular boulder up this particular mountain and instead just get people to adopt serious secure messengers.</td>\n",

You save some time compared to the original as you don&#x27;t have to repeat the dead ends and you might receive some samples and can skip parts of the preparation that way. But properly replicating a paper will still be a lot of effort, especially when there are any issues and it doesn&#x27;t work on the first try. Then you have to troubleshoot your experiments and make sure that no mistakes were made. That can add a lot of time to the process.<p>This is also all work that doesn&#x27;t benefit the scientists replicating the paper. It only costs them money and time.<p>If someone cares enough about the work to build on it, they will replicate it anyway. And in that case they have a good incentive to spend the effort. If that works this will indirectly support the original paper even if the following papers don&#x27;t specifically replicate the original results. Though this part is much more problematic if the following experiments fail, then this will likely remain entirely unpublished.

Moreover, as someone who is the most technically proficient person in the board, I can easily deduce that all the proposals about hows and whys of the ICO resembles an obfuscated fraud.

After trial and error with different models Gemini won because it was so darn easy to use and it worked with minimal effort. I think one shouldn&#x27;t underestimate that multi-modal, large context window model in terms of ease-of-use. Ironically this vendor is the best known and most successful vendor for OCR&#x27;ing this specific type of PDF but many of our requests failed over to their human-in-the-loop process. Despite it not being their specialization switching to Gemini was a no-brainer after our testing. Processing time went from something like 12 minutes on average to 6s on average, accuracy was like 96% of that of the vendor and price was significantly cheaper. For the 4% inaccuracies a lot of them are things like the text &quot;LLC&quot; handwritten would get OCR&#x27;d as &quot;IIC&quot; which I would say is somewhat &quot;fair&quot;. We probably could improve our prompt to clean up this data even further. Our prompt is currently very simple: &quot;OCR this PDF into this format as specified by this json schema&quot; and didn&#x27;t require some fancy &quot;prompt engineering&quot; to contort out a result.<p>Gemini developer experience was stupidly easy. Easy to add a file &quot;part&quot; to a prompt. Easy to focus on the main problem with weirdly high context window. Multi-modal so it handles a lot of issues for you (PDF image vs. PDF with data), etc. I can recommend it for the use case presented in this blog (ignoring the bounding boxes part)!</td>\n",

These valuations are high in part because for a decade you would not have beat the index without having these names in your portfolio.<p>3. These valuations blew up even further because of call squeezes during the 2020-2021 bull. Tesla even managed to get itself into the S&amp;P.<p>5. Then in December, the megacaps we&#x27;re squeezed further until the S&amp;P 500 had a negative return relative to price!<p>A lot of this occured because people remained under the impression that bond yields would never normalize. Now that they have, there is a risk free alternative to stocks.<p>Now for the next complications: Ukraine + Russia, economic war with  China, inflation, how the fed will respond, gas prices.<p>If inflation continues and the fed becomes aggressive with hiking, all assets are dead. Bonds will be wrecked, stocks will be wrecked, cash is wrecked, even gold (depending on how aggressively they hike) will be dead because it&#x27;s actually a really good deal to buy bonds when they yield north of 10% (if we get there).<p>Say the fed decides not to hike as aggressively and inflation slows, then you&#x27;ll be holding the S&amp;P 500 likely for yield than growth. In the case of a recession or further inflation, that yield may be at risk depending on the sectors you&#x27;re invested in.<p>In this context the correction in names like Target make perfect sense.

The product was worse and the team had to spend too much time (more than 0 minutes) explaining to a front end dev why a baseball box score had an order that stats were always displayed in because that’s the way fans expected it (true story).<p>I think the value of the question is that, all things being equal, do you want the person who wants to be there because they have a connection to what you do, or do you want someone who just wants a job?<p>I’d pick the former.</td>\n",

No one has given you a clear answer as to why your code is reinventing the wheel, so allow me to do it politely. I took every single example from your README, and show you below how everything can be reimplemented with sed -r (nice extended regex syntax, mostly like js regexs), and find/xargs:<p><pre><code>  replace 'var' 'let' *\\n  sed -ri 's,var,let,g' *\\n \\n  replace 'var' 'let' . -r\\n  find . -type f -print0 | xargs -0 sed -ri 's,var,let,g'\\n \\n  replace 'var' 'let' test/file1.js test/file2.js\\n  sed -ri 's,var,let,g' test/file1.js test/file2.js\\n \\n  replace '(\\w+)_(\\w+)' '$1-$2' *\\n  sed -ri 's,(\\w+)_(\\w+),\\1-\\2,g' *\\n \\n  replace 'var' 'let' . -r --include=\"*.js\"\\n  find . -type f -name '*.js' -print0 | xargs -0 sed -ri 's,var,let,g'\\n \\n  replace 'var' 'let' . -r --exclude=\"*.min.js,*.py\"\\n  find . -type f ! -name '*.min.js' ! -name '*.py' -print0 | xargs -0 sed -ri 's,var,let,g'\\n \\n  replace 'var' 'let' . -r --preview\\n  find . -type f -exec sh -c \"echo == {}; sed -r 's,var,let,g' {}\" \\;\\n  (not sure if --preview does exactly that, I echo the filename followed by the modified content)\\n</code></pre>\\nThere is only one case that justifies reimplementing things: if your tool has the requirement of supporting the <i>exact</i> js regex syntax, then yes you did the right thing to reimplement this in js. I have run into similar situations myself. One time I had to support Perl regexs, and I started by simply using Python's standard regex module, thinking that it would work because both Perl and Python use PCRE. Well as it turned out the regexs I encountered used some advanced features (such as negative/postive look-behind/look-ahead, etc) that Python's regex module plainly did not suppport. So I ended up rewriting part of my implementation in Perl.<p>Edit: I spoke too fast. As a commenter pointed out, other legitimate cases for reimplementing this in js would be when you can't afford to or don't want to fork a process to run find/xargs/sed. It sounds like you were running the tool from the command line, so I didn't think that would be your situation.<p>Edit 2: Yes, the exercise of reinventing the wheel is also useful for learning... I am not going to argue that.<p>Edit 3: If you care about <i>simplicity</i>, I would personally rather write a small shell script wrapping find/xargs/sed and hiding their arcane options, as opposed to writing 173 lines of js.</td>\n",

Is Amazon too big and a bully?<p>From my perspective, Amazon has made most of its profit price gouging consumers on bandwidth after vendor locking them into their ecosystem, where they bootstrap new services by wrapping open source software with some provisioning scripts, management dashboards and cookie-cutter API &#x2F; console templates. Indeed, most of this is templated -- AFAIU, for example, each AWS service autogenerates its Boto bindings and parts of its console frontend via code generators. Amazon has really mastered the factory process of churning out new services, and when they find a popular one, they can invest more resources into developing it than the original team ever could.<p>And therein lies the rub. If Amazon is improving the software in a way that the original team couldn&#x27;t, it&#x27;s hard to say that the community isn&#x27;t benefiting. I think what strikes me the wrong way is that Amazon is not doing it for any altruistic reason. In fact, Amazon contributes very little to open source in general, considering how much they take from it. Compare them to Facebook (React, etc) or Google (tons of dev tools) or Microsoft (VSC, TypeScript). What does Amazon have? Firecracker, kind of? And now a fork of ES because that&#x27;s the only way they could continue making money off it without violating the license a small startup put in place to stop them?<p>Well, good for Amazon, I suppose, but I find myself instinctively disliking them for this. I&#x27;m not sure what the solution is. Hopefully technologies like Kubernetes and Terraform will encourage big customers to become at least cloud-agnostic, if not cloud-independent. At the very least it would be great if Amazon &#x2F; Google &#x2F; Microsoft stopped gouging bandwidth at such absurd margins. Or not. Maybe it will be their downfall as startups differentiate along those lines. That would be ironic, coming from the originators of &quot;your margin is my opportunity.&quot;<p>Personally I&#x27;m doing my part by not building anything with vendor lock-in. It&#x27;s great to be able to deploy to any cloud, if you value either robustness or flexibility.</td>\n",

[‡] He knew almost nothing about computer languages, computer architecture, and according to Neil Young, he listened to vinyl records at home [1] — which shows that he was ignorant of how audio quality works (see [2]). Steve did not contribute any original ideas or any important technological innovations. He claimed during his Stanford commencement speech that if Macintosh had not included eye pleasing typography, then computers would never have had typographically pleasing typefaces (because \"Microsoft just copied Apple); this is ludicrous. In fact, Apple's software patents for digital typography added unnecessary difficulties. [3] Many people are unhappy about Apple culture of paranoia, litigation, and features that restrict user's freedoms that Steve created.<p>Steve is known for having a great sense of design, but it seems that he only had taste in choosing among the good designs of others. Just look at the yacht he designed without Jonathan Ive's collaboration. [4]<p>Many of you may say that I'm missing the point; that his ability to convince others of what was important and his \"vision\" is what made him great. My contention is that he appropriated other people's original ideas, and other people implemented his modifications. I'll admit that directing such efforts is not an easy thing to do, and most breakthroughs are improvements upon others' ideas. But it is very rare for the original creators to be alive and ignored while the modifier is celebrated with maudlin elegies.<p>EDIT: The media's treatment of his death, President Obama's statement that he was a great \"inventor\", etc. was not his fault. But I think that when the deaths of people like Dennis Ritchie and John McCarthy in the same month as Steve are ignored, then the world is suffering from a serious case of myopia. Ignoring Dennis and John while celebrating Steve is like fawning over the interior decorator with praise about the warmth of a house while ignoring the carpenter and contractor.<p>Perhaps I should add that I am being critical of Steve because of an abundance of articles that did not focus on what he actually contributed, or criticized only his behavior towards others. Steve did seem to be able to hire, attract, or motivate as many talented engineers as he did drive away. This is a very hard thing for a CEO to do, and he deserves a large amount of credit for doing this. The talent that he helped attract and the products they create are responsible for Apple's stock price rise and continued profitability since his death.<p>[‡] <a href=\"http://www.dourish.com/goodies/jargon.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.dourish.com/goodies/jargon.html</a>\\n    (see definition of \"hacker\")<p>[1] <a href=\"http://www.npr.org/blogs/thetwo-way/2012/02/01/146206585/steve-jobs-listened-to-vinyl-at-home-neil-young-says\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.npr.org/blogs/thetwo-way/2012/02/01/146206585/ste...</a><p>[2] <a href=\"http://people.xiph.org/~xiphmont/demo/neil-young.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://people.xiph.org/~xiphmont/demo/neil-young.html</a><p>[3] <a href=\"http://www.freetype.org/patents.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.freetype.org/patents.html</a><p>[4] <a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/2012/12/21/tech/innovation/steve-jobs-yacht/\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.cnn.com/2012/12/21/tech/innovation/steve-jobs-yac...</a></td>\n",

I loved having him on my team.<p>Eventually, other people started asking to work 3 days a week, suggesting that they too would pull all-nighters in an effort to have 2 mid-week days off.  I let a few experiments happen but sadly in most cases the result was less than 50% of what they had been previously able to accomplish.<p>This led to a new merit based working system when we placed emphasis on sprints and achieving.  This too ended up failing because the interconnected dependandcies of sprints were always bottlenecked by the slowest operator.<p>The final result was the eventual departure of my most prized teammate, and mostly due to peer pressure.  I often think about how I could have better allowed his brilliance while not alienating the rest of his team, but in the end I failed.</td>\n",

This article complains that users are trying to mitigate this problem, but doesn&#x27;t seem to give any solutions.<p>It&#x27;s entirely plausible you might have 20 accounts set up using TOTP on your phone.<p>If you now buy a new phone (which users might be doing once every 18-24 months), you need to log into each account and generate a new TOTP key and void the old. That&#x27;s a couple of hours work.<p>Now, what if you <i>lose</i> your phone?<p>You now have to <i>recover</i> 20 accounts, which will take several days, and it&#x27;s very possible you won&#x27;t be able to recover at least one.<p>The common response is &quot;Oh, you should keep one-time keys somewhere&quot;. Right, 20 * 10 one-time keys in a single centralised location, and make sure to update them to keep them valid. I thought we were trying to stop people writing their passwords down and storing them next to their computer?<p>Edit: I&#x27;m not sure &quot;treat your TOTP keys like passwords and store them&quot; is setting a very good example. Why are we developing systems that use TOTP if we are encouraging users to treat them like passwords, undoing the vast majority of the security benefit?</td>\n",

The idea for Replit was when you needed a repl to do some coding you should easily get one from anywhere including a mobile device. I thought it would benefit many people, especially those who don&#x27;t have the means to buy expensive computers.<p>It took 2 years of work to get something working and in 2011 we launched on HN (2011 web archive snapshot here <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;web.archive.org&#x2F;web&#x2F;20111007050930&#x2F;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;repl.it&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;web.archive.org&#x2F;web&#x2F;20111007050930&#x2F;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;repl.it&#x2F;</a> and HN launch here <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=3056490\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=3056490</a>).

I was thrilled about that.<p>Now, a lot of people implicitly assume that in a dispute between for-profit company and an open-source project, the for-profit company must be in the wrong. But there is some line that it&#x27;s unethical to cross in copying a former employer&#x27;s product (if you don&#x27;t believe that, you can stop reading now, because no argument will convince you) and I think to someone who knew Replit&#x27;s architecture well, this project would clearly \\nbe across it.

The new policy was still very generous (6 weeks PTO per year) so no one complained. Fast forward a year later and we were hearing things from executives and managers like, &quot;you know you don&#x27;t have to use all you&#x27;re PTO, right?&quot;. I&#x27;d ask, oh, it will rollover to next year? The reply: &quot;No, it won&#x27;t. But that&#x27;s really the wrong way to think about it.&quot;<p>So it turns out people were taking much more time off now than when PTO was unlimited. They started denying request and making up trivial rules, like 2&#x2F;3 of your team must be available at any time (regardless of the team size), oh, and those rules weren&#x27;t in the official policy. Good luck trying to get specifics in writing.<p>Eventually they changed back to an unlimited policy but secretly told managers they should start denying requests after x number of days have been used. I think it was five weeks, which again is still generous but it bothers me because the intent is to hide that number in hopes that people will use less. I also get no tracking for how many days I&#x27;ve already taken unless I go through my requests and count the approved ones myself.<p>The unlimited policy is definitely a scam at many companies. Most of my team has been denied requests for reasons that don&#x27;t exist in the written policy, like, &quot;you recently had PTO already.&quot; Honestly I&#x27;d rather have a policy that only allowed 3 or 4 weeks with a minimum mandatory that each employee is required to take at least two weeks off per year.</td>\n",

Someone else in the thread noted that they did have the bank&#x27;s phone number stored, which upped the credibility of the call to them.<p>- The caller called me twice in rapid succession (First ignore the call from a number you do not know. Then they call back again immediately: &quot;maybe this is urgent &#x2F; important&quot;). Another person in the thread, who fell for the scam, noted this same pattern.<p>- It is better if banks include a security warning &#x2F; specific reason the code is sent with the password reset pins and similar credentials. My bank did not. Another twitter user noted being subject to the scam, and just glancing over the warning copy. So it helps, but it is not perfect. Especially pre-coffee.<p>- My bank no longer allows me to reset my password without calling them (thanks bank).<p>When I read the thread now, it&#x27;s obviously full of red flags.

Converted the tables to InnoDB. Increased number of JVM threads to tomcat<p>3. 9 months - 5M users - Realized that the default MySQL config is for a desktop and allocates just 64MB RAM to the database. Setup the mysql configs. 2 application servers now.<p>4. 18 months - 15M users - Tuned MySQL even more. Optimized JDBC connector to cache MySQL prepared statements.<p>5. 36 months - 45M users - Split database by having different tables on different machines.<p>I had no idea or previous experience about any of these issues. However I always had enough notice to fix issues. Worked really hard, learnt along the way and was always able to find a way to scale the service.<p>I know of absolutely no service which failed because it couldn&#x27;t scale. First focus on building what people love. If people love your product, they will put up with the growing pains (e.g. Twitter used to be down a lot!).<p>Because of my previous experience, I can now build and launch a highly scalable service at launch. However the reason I do this is that it is faster for me to do it - not because I am building it for scale.<p>Launch as soon as you can. Iterate as fast as you can.

       "      <td>The pessimism in this thread really bothers me. I’ve read anecdotes on entrepreneurship being on the decline, but it pains me to read so many negative takes on startups. We’re actively training our young people to avoid taking risks, and it’s going to fuck us — especially if some of those young people have the ambition be early employees at, say, a startup that takes on climate change in a big way.<p>Look — the fact that Garry knew Peter Thiel when he was 23 is nuts. When I was 23 I was broke and living with my parents in the suburbs outside Toronto. I didn’t even personally know any other software engineers. I think many people here would relate more similarly to that position.<p>Just because he won the social lottery early, doesn’t mean his lessons are wrong. I got a junior engineering job in Toronto when I was 23, at a startup, making less than Garry. $57.5k CAD. I worked on  my open source portfolio and next took a job in another startup in SF for $120k USD the next year.<p>That startup failed. I took a brief job at a biotech startup after being turned down by Google and Facebook (twice). After three months I quit that startup to run the company I’m still running today, four years later. Today, we’re very fortunate to work with some of the largest companies in SV.<p>Reflecting on this: I think a better story Garry could’ve told is not that he missed out on $200M, but that startups basically built his network so that — years later — he’d be a prominent VC working with Alexis Ohanian, funding the next round of exciting companies. $200M is an eye-catching clickbait headline, but not the real substance. The real substance is — how the fuck did he meet Peter Thiel at 23, and how can somebody recreate that?<p>In the story I just told about myself, I got really lucky as a function of working at startups. I didn’t really make any money doing it. But a whole bunch of interesting things happened:<p>- The first job in SF I worked at introduced me to a product manager who went to school with Aston Motes, employee #1 at Dropbox who would eventually be an investor in the company I run today.<p>- The founder of that first failed company introduced me to AngelPad, the accelerator that gave me my first $50k in financing. The fact I stuck it out as an engineering lead at a failing startup helped: I gave it my all. (Aside: YC turned me down. Twice.)<p>- The biotech company I worked at was founded by two early SpaceX employees, one who would also become an investor later on.<p>Don’t work at startups to make $200M. Work at startups because you’ll work with people who have risk profiles that are much more likely to generate outsized returns as a group. You’ll have the opportunity to join or create a community of high-performing folks that, in aggregate, outperform anything you can do on your own. Maybe you’ll be the CEO one day, maybe not, but no matter what you are very likely to come out ahead if you apply yourself.<p>And don’t let the comments here dissuade you. Startups are hard, but they kick ass. I’ve cried myself to sleep some nights — as both an employee and CEO — and still wouldn’t change the experience for anything. I’m a better person because of what I’ve been through.</td>\n",

Now people use it implicitly to mean that they can say whatever they want, but also that they are entitled to have their thoughts broadcasted at large using the amplification mechanisms I mentioned above.<p>While I believe free speech is a good thing, I believe free amplification is terrible.<p>If you think about it, before social networks, amplification was done through TV and newspapers, and those have editorial boards that filters the content they share. If a newspaper&#x27;s staff is pro-environment, they can prevent any columnist writing anything that denies climate change, and it&#x27;s not controversial.<p>However the problem is how do we decide who can get free amplification and who can&#x27;t?

We&#x27;re on version 12 now and there&#x27;s so much stuff in there that sometimes modern C# code from experts looks unreadable to me.<p>One of the reasons I have so much fun working in node&#x2F;Javascript these days is because it is simple and not much has changed in express&#x2F;node&#x2F;etc for a long time. If I need an iterable that I can simply move through, I just do `let items = [];`. It is so easy and hasn&#x27;t changed for so many years. I worry that we eventually come out with a dozen ways to do an array and modern code becomes much more challenging to read.<p>When Typescript first came out, it was great. Types in Javascript are something we&#x27;ve always wanted. Now, Typescript is on version 5.6 and there is so much stuff you can do with it that it&#x27;s overwhelming. And nobody uses most of it!<p>This is probably just old man ranting, but I think there&#x27;s something there. The old version I used to debate about was C vs C++.

In this era of super crappy security, especially with consumer grade stuff, there&#x27;s a not insignificant chance your stuff is currently being hacked by one or more non-government bad actors (I already assume the US government, and probably a few other governments, already have 24&#x2F;7 access to every mic and camera that is connected to the web in any way).<p>I&#x27;ve been assuming voice commands will die out and that this Alexa &#x2F; Siri hype (hype might not be the right word. buzz? rumblings?) was a result of Amazon and Apple pushing them from a marketing perspective.

I do think that things &quot;look nicer&quot; and are more consistent, but at a lower level of quality. 20 years ago, I had only 5 or so choices for any given product, maybe a curtain rod for example (because I just bought some). Today I can go down to several stores and pick from hundreds of curtain rod designs that look really nice, but half of them break after a few years or less. I still have some shitty looking but sturdy curtain rods from 20 years ago, no joke. Electronics are worse in some ways, but faster and more complex, so maybe that complexity is the source of the decrease in perceived quality.

That trend in gaming bothers me to no end, and I refuse to knowingly install a game that features one.<p>The presence of 15 year old script kiddies using aimbots does NOT IN ANY WAY justify having kernel level control over my machine, Linux or otherwise. Valve, and every other company that contributes to gaming in general, kindly stay the fuck out of our kernels.<p>EDIT: I feel a few folks in the comments are getting mixed up between the concepts of DRM and kernel-level anti-cheat drivers. DRM is what keeps folks from pirating software, as well as diminishing the freedom of where and how you can install the software. It sucks, but I understand why it exists, and that isn&#x27;t what I&#x27;m talking about here<p>Kernel-level drivers, on the other hand, are drivers that run outside your sphere of influence (so-called user-space) and exist outside the checks and balances of your operating system that keep programs from doing whatever the hell they please.<p>Add on the fact that these programs are black boxes by design, and all of the sudden a company essentially has free reign to do whatever they want with your machine under your nose.

       "      <td>The first thing everyone needs to know about this is what the case was about, because it implicates one of the most powerful and least known rights tech company employees have.<p>According to Section 8(a)(1) of the NLRA, employees can&#x27;t generally be disciplined for exercising the rights provided under Section 7 of the NLRA. These rights are commonly understood to be about unionizing (ie, you can&#x27;t be fired for trying reasonably to organize a union), but are actually broader: the NLRA protects an employee right to almost arbitrary &quot;concerted action&quot; to improve working conditions.<p>Damore was terminated by Google for authoring his anti-diversity memo. During the time he was authoring and distributing internal copies of the memo, he worked with (apparently) a bunch of other engineers at Google that shared many of his viewpoints (the memo covers a lot of ground). He was terminated after the memo, an artifact of his concerted effort to change aspects of how Google was managed, was published. He and his lawyer mounted an 8(a)(1) complaint.<p>As a starting point --- people with real-world experience or understanding of the NLRA should correct me where I&#x27;m wrong --- NLRA complaints get filed with the National Labor Relations Board. The NLRB adjudicates claims internally. If a complaint is found valid, the NLRB will try to convince the employer to settle with the employee; if that goes nowhere, the NLRB will itself effectively sue the company. If the complaint is found invalid, the NLRB will inform the complainant that NLRB is done with the case.<p>Most of these cases (there are tens of thousands annually as you&#x27;d expect) are handled by grunts in DC. Novel or high-profile cases are escalated to a special department in the NLRB called the Advice Division. This particular case was not only escalated but apparently handled personally by the director of the division, an NLRB lawyer who&#x27;d been with the board since 1988.<p>The NLRB turned down Damore&#x27;s complaint. I think he could theoretically still sue in civil court? I don&#x27;t think that&#x27;s commonly done? Either way, his complaint was denied.<p>The basis for the complaint is super simple and kind of obvious in retrospect: employers in the US are required by federal and usually state law to avoid discrimination against protected classes. To the extent that Damore&#x27;s memo was about organizing against <i>discrimination of conservative viewpoints</i> --- a phenomenon that is almost certainly real in SFBA tech! --- it was protected. But to the extent that it attempted to organize around changes to Google management that might (might) themselves violate EEO laws (for instance, any kind of official recognition that men are better suited to software development at Google than women), they were not. You can&#x27;t use the NLRA to organize in opposition to federal employment law. Wa-waa.<p>As it turns out, this was apparently super-apparent to Google legal and Google HR, who fired Damore precisely by the book, exclusively for promoting stereotypes about women and advocating for the inclusion of those stereotypes into Google&#x27;s management processes.<p>I think an important thing to consider --- I&#x27;m no lawyer and am probably wrong about lots of this stuff --- is that if the memo had been exclusively about how SFBA tech discriminates against conservatives and could in a number of ways be made more accommodating to them, Damore would had been protected from retaliation. The Advice Memo says as much!<p>So for someone like me, who believes very strongly in both the importance of employee organizing rights (I think tech should organize into professional associations; &quot;unions lite&quot;) <i>and</i> who believes strongly in the absolute innate equivalence in aptitude for our profession between men and women, this is the best possible outcome. There&#x27;s a lot to take heart in here; we do in fact have the right to organize that we&#x27;ve been saying we have.</td>\n",

At the heart of every conversation about system design or product proposal lies an unspoken (and sometimes spoken) question: will working on this get me promoted?<p>The criteria for promotion at Google, especially at the higher levels like SWE III -&gt; Senior and especially at Senior -&gt; Staff and above, explicitly talk about impact on the organization and the business. This has consequences for the kind of teams people try to join and kind of work they choose to do. Maintenance engineering is so not-rewarded that it&#x27;s become an inside joke. Any team that isn&#x27;t launching products starts bleeding staff, any project that isn&#x27;t going to make a big splash is going to be neglected, and any design that doesn&#x27;t &quot;demonstrate technical complexity&quot; will be either rejected or trumped up.<p>This is as important in the product management, people management, and general leadership roles as in engineering. The incentive throughout is to create a product, launch it, apply for promotion, and move on to bigger and better things as soon as possible. In my time at Google I saw organization after organization pay lip service to rewarding maintenance and &quot;preferring landings over launches&quot; and “improving product excellence” but (at least in my experience) nothing stuck.<p>Usually an organization starts with a top-down direction and the rest of the company is compensated for executing it. Not at Google. The &quot;let a thousand flowers bloom&quot; approach that developed from the early days of twenty percent time and total engineering independence has created a disorganized mess of a company. Multiply the individual incentives fifty thousand times and you get a company that throws stuff at the wall to see if it sticks, and if it doesn&#x27;t kills it immediately.<p>Edit&#x2F;Addendum:<p>This is also why GMail, YouTube, Search, GCP, Android, and others aren’t going anywhere. They’re making money, they’re core to the business, and there’s plenty of opportunity to work on them and get promoted. They all also share one thing in common: deep down they’re frontends for search or advertising (GCP and Apps are an exception because they make money on their own). Measuring and proving impact on search numbers is a well-known promo narrative at Google, so those products are a safe bet for employees and users. Streaming game services, not so much.</td>\n",

Sure, sexism might be annoying, but in the west, it is hardly something that creates a genuine barrier for women.<p>Startups have it worst, and everday I count the number of years I have to work in the high stress places I want or do a startup if I want to have two kids before 35. No one talks about planning around fertility. When I mention it to someone that I want to take time off for a couple years to have children in silicon valley, they look at me as if I&#x27;m an alien. As if wanting to be pregnant and not working at the same time as being sleep deprived and wanting to spend time with my own baby when they are at their youngest is some strange outlandish fantasy.<p>All careers are built this way. PhD to tenure, startups, generally high stress professions. I wish the world wasn&#x27;t so male centric, that feminists actually cared about finding structural solutions instead of forcing women to become copies of men to achieve gender parity. But they care more about power than actual equality where we acknowledge that women have different needs and desires, that those needs and desires are equally valuable and not inferior to desires men have, that the two genders have different strengths and capabilities and it is equally important to reward both. And maybe not wanting to outsource your baby to a nanny during their most vulnerable years is not a heretical thought.<p>I wish we had more focus in allowing people to transition back from taking a few years off to raise young kids, and it wasn&#x27;t automatically assumed that you would be a worse founder or professor or software engineer just because you have 2-4 years you didn&#x27;t commercially work. Hell, I want to take that time to contribute to open source, something I don&#x27;t get to do much usually and I&#x27;m looking forward to it because I am willing to face the  consequences.

I&#x27;ve gone from writing code and producing features, to a full-time mentor and babysitter. \\nHalf of the boot-camp graduates I believe have become coders for the wrong reasons like:<p>* developers have an easy life, getting into work whenever they choose<p>* they get to wear t-shirts and baggy jeans<p>* they get all the latest toys to play around with and shiny MacBooks<p>* I hated my last job, looking at developers on TV in these Silicon valley places looks like the dream life<p>* I am a single mother who was given the course for free<p>The others, have aptitude but are so inexperienced from their 3 month session that it will take them atleast two years before they can be fully independant engineers.<p>These codecamps are licenses to print money it seems, they charge the students a hefty fee for the course and companies then pay a recruitment fee at the end.<p>Needless to say, I will be leaving my company very soon to go to a place where there is a coding test and filtering to prevent most of these bootcampers from getting in.<p>Yes its snobby, but I didn&#x27;t study and spend my student loan on my passion just so I can train up a bunch of people looking for the &quot;easy life&quot;.</td>\n",

Low-heat-low-variance is better for mass food production, because producers can just dose the capsaicin directly, which is something they can&#x27;t do easily when every pepper is a wildcard.<p>There are second-order effects, like drip irrigation and cultivation techniques that optimize for shape, size, and color over heat --- but those are enabled by the industrial jalapeno&#x27;s new position in the production chain. The peppers just aren&#x27;t the point where the heat is introduced anymore; that happens later. Might as well optimize for good looking peppers.<p>This seems fine? Peppers are one of the easier and more forgiving things to grow yourself. Just grow your own or buy from a farmer&#x27;s market.<p><i>Moments later, after reading the thread</i><p>This kind of stuff really seems to piss people off, but when you think about the disempowerment of the jalapeno, try to keep in mind that the same industrial processes have performed unalloyed positive things.

It doesn’t really matter whether a wind farm in the German North Sea can produce a lot of electricity cheaply during a windy day when that electricity is needed three days later in Munich.<p>This complete lack of matching supply and demand is what drives electricity prices with a large share of renewables in the market so high.<p>In Germany, lots of electricity is produced from renewables at times when it’s not needed. This causes market prices to be negative at times and Germany is paying neighboring countries money to buy that excess electricity.<p>At the same time, producers of renewables have guaranteed sales by German law, i.e. their electricity is always bought by the market whether it’s needed or not.<p>It’s this gap between supply and demand that customers are paying for which drives German electricity prices.<p>Currently, we’re paying 31 Euro cents in Germany per kWh while French customers whose grid has a large share of nuclear pay just 17 Euro cents per kWh on average.<p>At the same time, the average CO2 emissions in Germany per kWh are at 400 grams in Germany while they’re only at 50 grams in France. That’s because whenever solar and wind aren’t delivering any electricity we’re starting up coal and gas plants.<p>I wish proponents renewables were honest enough to not withhold these problems.<p>I mean, absolutely no one argues that it’s not that expensive to build a wind or solar farm. What makes wind ans solar expensive is keeping the necessary backup plants in standby for when they’re not delivering and paying for getting rid of excess electricity from renewables when they’re not needed.<p>The intermittency and low energy density are inherent physical properties of solar and wind farms which is why 100% renewables is newer feasible (unless for countries like Norway who have the possibility to build lots of hydro plants).</td>\n",

Google kills products that make customers and engineers happy and doesn&#x27;t spend enough effort to make them better.<p>The industry is eating the commons: The web is turning into shit. Devices are being locked down. Ads and tracking are everywhere. Open source is being co-opted, but the benefits are not returned. The cool things to hack on and integrate with (remember &quot;mashups&quot;?) are all siloed up, full of ads, and dumbed down to the most basic products.<p>The Internet now treats everyone using it like we&#x27;re all brainless idiots to be injected with dopamine.

It makes it sound like Scotland is wind powered 97% of the time (only 3% more to go!), which is very different.<p>There is an increasing crisis in the UK of negative electricity prices (typically when it is sunny, windy and lower demand in the summer). Last year had more time than ever in negative, and the UK has another 10-20GW of commited offshore wind in construction.<p>Once this comes online, wind generation will often be over 100% of demand UK wide (right now it peaks over 50% regularly). There is approx 5GW of HVDC (with 1-2&#x2F;GW a year more planned over the next while), but it won&#x27;t be enough to export all of it outside the UK (and when it is windy here, it is likely to also be there, so they won&#x27;t want it either).<p>This is going to end up with very negative prices for a lot of the time. Considering ~15% of UK supply is made up with nuclear, this is a real problem. You can&#x27;t stop start nuclear like you can with gas.<p>So we are going to have to pay massive sums of money to wind producers to shut off production. And we are still going need masses of gas backup which is going to be used increasingly inefficiently to pick up the slack.<p>This may spur innovation in storage, but we are talking enormous quantities required in a very short period of time.</td>\n",

In the case of this proposal this sort of objection is particularly strong, since (though the blog post is silent as to what the treatment is) it&#x27;s given that they are fractions from blood, so they&#x27;re substances which the body produces in some quantity anyway, and which are sufficiently non-dose-specific that Katcher, with limited resources, could devise a reasonably effective regimen.<p>Parabiosis is one of the most striking (and just weird) phenomena in aging research, so efforts to understand what&#x27;s going on with it are liable to bear interesting fruit.

I&#x27;m not saying this logic is <i>valid</i>, but it&#x27;s how we got here, imho.<p>First: we no longer trust the hiring manager alone, because probably they aren&#x27;t a strong developer. We instead trust strong developers that are well trained at evaluating good devs. At the same time, we don&#x27;t want to thrust a dev onto a hiring manager, so they <i>also</i> need to interview you too and have a say.<p>Second: Is it really fair to have just one or two developers evaluate you? When I first was an interviewer, I liked everybody! I would have hired them all. So getting multiple data points <i>matters</i>. Best to have at least a couple dev interviews.<p>Then there&#x27;s the whole problem of needing to evaluate you on multiple dimensions. Can one interview really tell if you&#x27;re good problem solving, coding, algorithms&#x2F;data structures, and any specialization the role has? What about the soft skills aspect? We&#x27;re going to need to have at least 3 or 4 interviews to cover all these aspects. These roles pay a huge sum of money, so there&#x27;s a lot of worry that someone will be hired who doesn&#x27;t really meet the bar, you know?<p>But now we have a bigger problem: if we&#x27;re going to invest 4+ people to spend an hour of time with you each, we&#x27;d better have <i>some</i> data points that you&#x27;re worth that investment. So maybe we need one or two initial interviews ahead of time to weed out any obviously unlikely candidates.<p>After that, it&#x27;s every other company going &quot;Oh shit, Amazon does 6 interviews? We should do that too!&quot;.</td>\n",

A consequence is that, for example, with treble clef, you find C&#x27; in the top but one position <i>between</i> lines, and thus at a very different place than C (one octave below) visually, which is <i>on</i>, rather than between, an additional line below the bottom-most regular line.<p>I for one know that my dyslexia when it comes to musical notation (eg. not recognizing notes fast enough to play by the sheet) has kept me from becoming proficient on the piano (well, that, and my lazyness).</td>\n",

The problem with inflation is that its calculation is fraught with all kinds of selective weighting, bias, and politics. Take a look at the relative differences between the things which have decreased and increased in cost in real terms (<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;static.seekingalpha.com&#x2F;uploads&#x2F;2017&#x2F;5&#x2F;29&#x2F;saupload_inflation10-16.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;static.seekingalpha.com&#x2F;uploads&#x2F;2017&#x2F;5&#x2F;29&#x2F;saupload_i...</a>). Okay, so TVs and cellphones are cheaper, but necessities like college, childcare, and healthcare are up significantly.<p>And when you drill in more, there are other issues. For example, the housing metric appears relatively flat in real terms, right? Except, that doesn&#x27;t tell the story for the majority of Americans. Housing costs are WAY up in cities as Americans migrate to where the jobs are, while housing costs are down in all the areas where jobs are disappearing. In practise, housing costs are actually significantly up for most Americans, but because the CPI is calculated across the entire nation, the government can claim inflation is low. This allow them to keep the fed rate low, which keeps stock valuations high. This LOOKS great and generates great headlines, but the reality is that most Americans are significantly worse off since the 1970s.<p>And then we come to the other elephant in the room: why are real wages flat? Given the incredible performance of the American economy since 1970, shouldn&#x27;t real wages be significantly UP? This is yet another reminder that wealth is being squeezed from the bottom and funnelled straight up. As a non-American, it&#x27;s heartbreaking to see efforts to unify the underclass completely derailed by this ridiculous race war. Poor people in America have FAR more in common with each other than the rich, no matter race. I really hope you all manage to set aside the obvious red herring of race and unite in tackling your staggering wealth inequality.</td>\n",

Sales may think you&#x27;re going to launch on time, but it&#x27;s in their financial interest to think so. The rest of the org probably made a schedule they know you can&#x27;t meet because they think it motivates you to work harder.<p>Second, unless you&#x27;re in a startup where everyone&#x27;s inexperienced, most people probably already know you&#x27;ll be late, but aren&#x27;t saying it out loud. They likely have discussed it (up the chain) in meetings you&#x27;re not in.<p>Third, people do shoot the bearer of bad news. You can earn a rep as a negative person if you make _true_ predictions out-loud that don&#x27;t fit the common desire. This is especially true if some of the senior people who know (like your boss) haven&#x27;t been forthcoming with their bosses.<p>Have a quiet conversation with your boss over lunch or beers - not a meeting - and tell him&#x2F;her what you think. Be prepared with details, but if he&#x2F;she doesn&#x27;t ask for them, don&#x27;t provide any. There&#x27;s a good chance he&#x2F;she already knows as you suspect.<p>Even more casually (lunch&#x2F;beers), express your concerns to the project owner. It&#x27;s probably not new news to him&#x2F;her either. Being &quot;positive&quot; is a huge part of the corporate game.:  Again, if no details are asked for, don&#x27;t provide any.

The language itself is amazing, the pattern matching is super expressive, the borrow checker is incredible in the kinds of errors it can pick up on, and rust-analyzer is leagues beyond where RLS was. But... the compile times are an absolute non-starter for me. I&#x27;m the kind of guy that likes to re-run his code continually to see if it validates to what I expect it to be doing. In Rust, this kind of workflow just doesn&#x27;t work at all. The long compile times completely kill any enjoyment or flow that I normally get out of productive programming. Even worse, I found myself anxious to introduce new dependencies, because each new crate would add a few more seconds to the compile time, which immediately correlates to less coding enjoyment.<p>I keep reading in Rust surveys that Rustaceans just don&#x27;t care that much about compile times enough to prioritize improving them. I&#x27;ve often wondered how this can be possible, given that to me it&#x27;s such an obvious glaring issue that all the other cited problems are distant distant seconds at best. I have a theory: there must be two groups of engineers. One group loves fast compile times and quickly validating hypotheses. The other group must value thinking about their code a lot more than running it, and so compile times aren&#x27;t that important. My guess is that, while the second group hangs around and loves Rust, Rust has <i>completely</i> driven away the first group (including myself) to the degree that they don&#x27;t use the language enough to even fill out the surveys.<p>Anyways, I know it has a wide swath of use cases, mostly in systems programming.

While I agree that the UX of many Google products needs fixing, it&#x27;s not just a simple matter of &quot;Google, you are made out of money. Fix your fucking interfaces.&quot;<p>The article misses a really important point that you can&#x27;t just revamp the UX for a product used by billions of users without some pretty serious blowback. Startups like Notion have a great deal of flexibility to tweak and innovate on their UX as much as they like, but even changing something minor in Gmail or Google Docs impacts orders of magnitude more people, using the product in such a huge number of environments -- phones, tablets, PCs -- in every language and every corner of the world. Every time Google has tried to make a major UX change -- look at Inbox, for example -- the challenges of bringing all of the existing users over to the new experience are very real. As a result, the UX tends to evolve in smaller steps, which (of course) results in the final result being more of a hodgepodge than you would get if you just started from scratch.<p>Google has very good UX designers, UX researchers, product managers, and engineers. These people know how to design good user experiences and care very much about the end result. But there is the reality of being boxed into design decisions that are difficult to undo without making some really major changes that are highly disruptive. Now, you could just say that Google should bite the bullet and hit reboot on some of its bad UX decisions from years ago. That is always an option, but it is often difficult to justify the benefits of an improved UX versus the productivity hit to all of the existing users.</td>\n",

The period of flattening coincides with the heyday of the large corporation.<p>Large corporations tend to decrease economic inequality. You can't measure individual productivity well within large organizations, and even if you could, it would strain the fabric of the organization to reward people that way.  They also hide a lot of inequality by giving elite employees benefits that don't show up in their salaries (<a href=\"http://paulgraham.com/ladder.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://paulgraham.com/ladder.html</a>).<p>What happened at the end of the 1970s was that the most ambitious people started to lose interest in working their way up the corporate ladder.  They wanted to get paid upfront.  That was why the term \"yuppie\" was born then.  Before 1980 it was rare to find young professionals with lots of money.  In the old days, they were all still paying their dues at that age.<p>I remember the transition quite clearly.  When I was a little kid, in the early 70s, the most impressive thing you could do was to work for a large corporation.  It was the era of conglomerates in shiny office towers.  By 1980 we were starting to see a glimpse of the world we now live in, where the ambitious people are all free agents.</td>\n",

Now, when the company cracks down, users think their freedoms are being curtailed. The mistake was ever allowing that kind of freedom in the first place, because people developed an expectation that it would persist.<p>Compounding that problem, the fact that the site was unregulated for so long caused it to attract the kind of people who need to be regulated the most. In other words, it&#x27;s no surprise that the most tolerant communities attract people who are difficult to tolerate.<p>I suspect Twitter is having similar issues dealing with harassment, after letting it happen for so long. If there is a lesson in this, it is that online communities which plan to implement anti-harassment policies ought to do so from the beginning, and develop the expectation among the users that such policies exist, and will continue to exist. Don&#x27;t just tack them on after several years, and don&#x27;t enforce them inconsistently and arbitrarily as Reddit has done.<p>It will be difficult for Condé Nast to get its money&#x27;s worth out of Reddit now.

We basically do it row-by-row: as the people in front of them leave, people in a row get up, get their bags, start walking down the line, and this cascades up the plane. The problem is that there is very little parallelism: while people in the next row to leave are getting their bags, no one is exiting the plane.<p>This is similar to a stall in a processor pipeline. We want to avoid stalls, which mean that we want people exiting the plane constantly. A <i>column</i> approach would work much better: people in the aisle get their bags before the doors open, and start leaving as soon as it does. As columns drain, the next column can get their bags and start to leave. This approach keeps people leaving constantly, while also keep the aisle constantly populated. Yes, the person in the last column in the back row still leaves last, but I claim they will leave sooner. (edit: Thinking about it more, I actually think the people in the last column in the <i>front</i> row leave last. If you&#x27;re in the back row, second column, you can stand up as soon as the person in the first column in front of you has started walking out. After the first column to leave, people will exit in reverse order because the openings will appears back-to-front. Trying to maintain front-row &quot;fairness&quot; will just result in a period of time where no one is in the aisle.)<p>The reason we do the row-by-row method, I think, is that our sense of fairness is influenced by who we&#x27;re looking at and proximity. We look forward, and we feel that the people closer to the door &quot;should&quot; leave first because they&#x27;re closer, and we&#x27;re looking at them, so we feel bad if we hold them up. But by doing the row-by-row method, we&#x27;re holding up everyone <i>behind us</i>, but we don&#x27;t look at them as much.<p>I don&#x27;t know how to enforce a column-by-column exit. Airlines can enforce how we get on the plane because they control, person at a time, who enters the plane. How we exit the plane is more cultural, and while an airline could certainly try to ask people to exit this way, it&#x27;s much harder to make it happen.</td>\n",

You&#x27;ve never heard of it unless you&#x27;re a professional trader, but it&#x27;s actually quite fascinating to read up on.<p>Trading looks instantaneous. But settlement takes a few days. In between are a series of credit agreements. From your broker to you. From the clearinghouse to the brokers. DTCC is the clearinghouse. Robinhood is the broker.<p>There are rules and contracts between DTCC and its members, including Robinhood [2]. Those contracts ensure that when you buy shares through your broker from a Robinhood customer, if Robinhood falls down two days later, there is collateral sufficient to make you whole. Those collateral requirements change in reference to, amongst other things, the volatility of the security. (If a broker falls down, the clearinghouse liquidates their collateral and makes their counterparty whole. More volatility means more chance the collateral will be insufficient.)<p>In this case, collateral requirements on GME went up. Because of its volatility. So while before Robinhood had to pony up collateral for a few shares of GME for every hundred it traded, it now had to, at close of business, pony up one hundred shares&#x27; worth of collateral for every hundred it traded. That creates a cash crunch. One that exacerbates itself with every additional trade in the security. If Robinhood fails to satisfy those collateral calls, they go out of business overnight. Into receivership. Done.<p>Most brokers have policies for these situations. Higher brokerage fees for securities on a schedule. Not making shares and cash from trades available until the trade settles, sort of like what banks do for large cheques. But I don&#x27;t know if Robinhood is able to do that quickly.

I&#x27;ll never get out of the car in a storm again, at least not without thinking very carefully about the situation first.<p>My other near miss experience was staying at a bread-and-breakfast farmhouse in Portugal. I had taken a shower, and was standing in front of the bathroom mirror, when I noticed the light above the mirror was crooked. It was one of those swiveling can fixtures, so I reached up to adjust it. I knew it wouldn&#x27;t be hot since I&#x27;d just turned it on, so I grabbed it firmly and then asked myself why it was vibrating. And for that matter why was my whole arm vibrating? When I realized I was being shocked I was able to let go and spent 20 minutes pacing around my room making sure I wasn&#x27;t dead. You really can&#x27;t do worse than standing barefoot, soaking wet, on a stone floor, and grabbing a live fixture, can you?<p>If anyone would like to explain why that didn&#x27;t kill me I&#x27;m all ears.</td>\n",

I no longer crave restaurant food, and all of the really important things I learned about cooking take just the time to read it, hear about it and then try it. All without any special hardware.<p>A few examples:<p>1. Cooking jasmine rice: rinse it first, 1 c. water to 1 c. rice ratio. Bring to boil, turn down heat to lowest setting. Leave lid &#x2F;the entire time&#x2F;. Fluff the rice (look this up) when done. (about 12-15 min of cooking)<p>2. Baking a cake: (any square pan yellow cake) Read how baking powder actually works, then you realize you need to mix and bake quickly. Letting it sit before baking will make a flatter cake. Also, stick a butter knife in the middle to test when it&#x27;s done, if it comes out with batter stuck on it, it needs a few more minutes.<p>3. Eggs: When frying, scrambling, put the eggs in warm water before cracking to make them room temperature first. They cook better this way.<p>4. Chocolate syrup: 1 c. water, 1 c. cocoa power, 1 c. sugar, 1&#x2F;2 tsp vanilla, 1&#x2F;2 tsp salt. Blend it in a blender. (sealed container works best, as it&#x27;s messy) Better than store bought, super cheap, use organic if you like...<p>etc...<p>Why is this valuable? Because I am no longer tempted to waste money at restaurants any more, or buy unique expensive organic products (because I can make them now). I feel incredibly free and liberated that I get food at home that tastes better than what is at a restaurant now. (for about 90% of the stuff I like)<p>Also, I can teach my kids, and they start life with these skills. Great question, way too many things to write down...</td>\n",

Sure, the ability of LLMs to generate &quot;decent&quot; code from a prompt is pretty impressive, but I don&#x27;t think they are biger than Stack Overflow or IDEs.<p>So far my experience is that ChatGPT is great for generating code from languages I not proficient in or when I don&#x27;t remember how to do something and I need a quick fix.

It is my belief that if you are proficient enough in the task at hand, it is actually a distraction to be checking &quot;someone else code&quot; over just writing it yourself. When I wrote the code, I know it by heart and I know what it does (or is supposed to do). At least for me, having to be creating prompts and then reviewing the code that generates is slower and takes me out of the flow. It is also more exhausting than just writing the thing myself.<p>2. I am only able to check the correctness of the code, if am am proficient enough as a programmer (and possibly in the language as well). To become proficient I need to write a lot of code, but the more I use LLMs, the less repetitions I get in. So in a way it feels like LLMs are going to make you a &quot;worse&quot; programmer by doing the work for you.<p>Does anyone feel that way?

That&#x27;s just my approximation of the state of accessibility these days.\\nNow imagine that you live in the world where you don&#x27;t know which printer or wi-fi router to buy, since maybe half of them you won&#x27;t be able to use.\\nImagine that you cannot order from some online stores. You cannot fly certain airlines. And apparently you cannot order some pizza online.\\nWorst of all you don&#x27;t magically know whether a web site is accessible or not. You just go to web site and try it, spend some time to learn the layout - it typically takes blind peple longer to familiarize with new web sites, spend thirty minutes to fill out the details of your order  and then when you try to click the submit button, you figure out that it wouldn&#x27;t click for some reason. Being a developer you open HTML code just to realize that this is some weird kind of button that can only be clicked with the mouse, but not a screenreader. But hey, your screenreader can route the mouse cursor to this button and simulate a click. So you try a real mouse click and it still doesn&#x27;t work for some reason, and I have no idea why. Finally, you give up.\\nI hope I managed to convey a typical sense of frustration with a web-site that is not that accessible. I do  get arguments of other people that it might be hard for small businesses to make their web sites accessible. and I don&#x27;t know where to draw a line, but I need to say that Domino&#x27;s is a large enough company and even though I hate counting other companies&#x27; money, I must say they&#x27;re big enough to be able to afford to make their web-site accessible.</td>\n",

I joined about 4 years ago.<p>I am awed by the fact that we manage to release any software at all, let alone functional software.<p>The biggest problem is communication. No one fucking communicates.<p>- No communication between orgs. Tons of bureaucratic tape to cut through just to get a hand on someone working on a different product<p>- Barely any communication between teams. Literally every group of 4 people is in a little silo with no incentive to go outside it<p>- Broken management structure. I have had many managers (a red flag in itself) but even worse none of the managers take suggestions from engineers. Everything is purely top down. If an engineer realizes there is a problem on a macro scale they cannot fix it. It is literally impossible to unite more than 1.5 teams to get anything done.<p>- So what happens is that you’re working on a product that’s part of another product but you never talked to any other teams or orgs on how to make your product fit in<p>- 10 different teams working on the same products and services. Zero unification means you are literally wasting developers and internally fragmenting every tool. Even worse, these teams compete for internal market domination<p>- Culture of secrecy means nothing gets fucking done. You file a bug report and you can’t even see it any more for some orgs<p>This is only the tip of the iceberg. There are fundamental and serious problems at Apple that no one in management gives a shit about solving. Any time engineers try to congregate or work on anything constructive with another team, they are shot down.<p>The only time I have seen cross-team developers working together has been to deal with critical bugs.<p>Because of the lack of communication, none of management’s goals align. They are all out of sync and poorly thought out. So year after year your manager has something they want you to implement but the feature for the year is bullshit because it makes no sense and is just there to pad the manager’s resume.<p>And you can’t speak out about this. Apple doesn’t take well to employees complaining. Even then, because of the lack of organization there is no one you could raise these issues with.</td>\n",

Entire human lives are being wasted on this dystopia of boredom and meaninglessness. I would argue that part of the stalemate is caused by politics and social norms.

I&#x27;m talking a small fine if you don&#x27;t show up to a polling place and get your name checked off;<p>2. Preferential voting. Vote for the candidates in the order you want. The one with the least primary votes gets eliminated and those votes get distributed to the second preferences. This continues until one candidate has 50.1% of the vote. This way you can vote for a third-party candidate without wasting your vote.<p>3. Voting over a two day period, probably Saturday and Sunday. This will allow you to use a whole host of government buildings as polling places such as schools that are almost by definition widely geographically distributed;<p>4. Zero electronic voting. None. Nada. Zilch. More, the standards need to be tightened to have high accuracy voting methods. Optically read ballots where you fill in a circle work wondrously well. Punch cards do not. See the Florida recount of 2000 if you want to see what happens with that;<p>5. An end to politicizing the election process. It&#x27;s incredibly dangerous. No more elections for a supervisor of elections or the like. Other countries seem to manage with an electoral commission. The US can too;<p>6. An end to state governments controlling redistricting. The same electoral commission(s) should handle this.<p>Of course, none of this will actually happen.<p>EDIT: several commenters raised three points in particular.<p>1. Mandatory voting. I come from Australia where we have mandatory voting. By &quot;mandatory&quot; it means you just have to show up to a polling place and get your name ruled out of a large file. It&#x27;s slightly more tedious if you vote out of your registered district but only slightly.<p>There&#x27;s nothing stopping you putting an empty ballot in the box or drawing a picture or just voting invalid. There is no free speech issue here.<p>I used to be against it until I came to the US to see what havoc voluntary voting wreaks.<p>The US has a long history of voter suppression because voting isn&#x27;t mandatory. Getting out the vote is one thing. But the US in parts goes much further than this including:<p>- Removing your vote if you&#x27;re convicted of a felony. Why exactly?<p>- Removing you from the electoral rolls if your name matches that of a felon on the other side of the country;<p>- Sending mail to your registered address. If it&#x27;s returned undeliverable, strike you off the rolls;<p>- Making you wait hours to vote to discourage you from voting, particularly in areas heavily populated with those that might otherwise vote against you (in Australia it never took me more than about 5-10 minutes to vote).<p>People argue about the evils of having the uninformed vote but if Trump has taught us nothing it&#x27;s that choosing to vote isn&#x27;t exactly a recipe for informed voting either.<p>All of the above are a direct consequence of a politicized electioneering process made possible by non-mandatory voting.<p>2. Electronic voting. This is a recipe for a foreign power or just a hacker to steal your election by modifying the results in a database rather than interfering with paper ballots that can be audited and recounted.<p>Sure you can ballot stuff with fake ballots but that&#x27;s something that requires physical proximity and is far harder to do on the scale that large scale tampering with a database might mean.<p>Electronic voting is a wholly terrible idea with literally no upside.<p>3. Mail in ballots. All in favour of it if it&#x27;s like Oregon where you have the month before the election to send it in. It needs to be easy and flexible.</td>\n",

Remember how it works. It visually recognizes rear ends of cars using a BW camera and Mobileye (at least in early models) vision software. It also recognizes lane lines and tries to center between them. It has a low resolution radar system which ranges moving metallic objects like cars but ignores stationary obstacles. And there are some side-mounted sonars for detecting vehicles a few meters away on the side, which are not relevant here.<p>The system performed as designed. The white lines of the gore (the painted wedge) leading to this very shallow off ramp become far enough apart that they look like a lane.[1] If the vehicle ever got into the gore area, it would track as if in a lane, right into the crash barrier. It won&#x27;t stop for the crash barrier, because <i>it doesn&#x27;t detect stationary obstacles.</i> Here, it sped up, because there was no longer a car ahead. Then it lane-followed right into the crash barrier.<p>That&#x27;s the fundamental problem here. These vehicles will run into stationary obstacles at full speed with no warning or emergency braking at all.  <i>That is by design.</i> This is not an implementation bug or sensor failure. It follows directly from the decision to ship &quot;Autopilot&quot; with that sensor suite and set of capabilities.<p>This behavior is alien to human expectations. Humans intuitively expect an anti-collision system to avoid collisions with obstacles. This system does not do that. It only avoids rear-end collisions with other cars.  The normal vehicle behavior of slowing down when it approaches the rear of another car trains users to expect that it will do that consistently. But it doesn&#x27;t really work that way. Cars are special to the vision system.<p>How did the vehicle get into the gore area? We can only speculate at this point. The paint on the right edge of the gore marking, as seen in Google Maps, is worn near the point of the gore. That may have led the vehicle to track on the left edge of the gore marking, instead of the right. Then it would start centering normally on the wide gore area as if a lane. I expect that the NTSB will have more to say about that later. They may re-drive that area in another similarly equipped Tesla, or run tests on a track.<p>[1] <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;goo.gl&#x2F;maps&#x2F;bWs6DGsoFmD2\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;goo.gl&#x2F;maps&#x2F;bWs6DGsoFmD2</a></td>\n",

We should be reacting rationally to rates of hospitalization and deaths -- and right now, those are barely changed in NYC, thanks to the very high vaccination rate amongst the vulnerable population:<p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www1.nyc.gov&#x2F;site&#x2F;doh&#x2F;covid&#x2F;covid-19-data-trends.page\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www1.nyc.gov&#x2F;site&#x2F;doh&#x2F;covid&#x2F;covid-19-data-trends.pag...</a><p>One can certainly argue that there exist small groups of people for whom the vaccine is not perfect protection. This is true, but it&#x27;s no different than <i>all other viruses</i>, which have threatened immunocompromised people forever. We have never before justified such intrusive government policies based on the risks faced by these individuals. So while I empathize with them, this still seems like over-reach to me.</td>\n",

Tickets are $45 for SFO-LAX each way in February right now (less than the expected cost of the train ticket).  Other pairs (OAK-BUR, SJC-BUR) are similar ($49-$57 each way).<p>Before you say that it&#x27;s ridiculous, consider how else $64 billion (current official estimated total construction cost of the project -- not counting operating cost)[0] could be spent:<p>- Commercial air travel costs around $0.10 per passenger-mile if you buy in bulk[1].  That means $64 billion could buy 640 billion passenger-miles of air travel.  If allocated to the 11 million people who live in Los Angeles and San Francisco counties, the state could buy each resident 58,000 air miles of travel -- equivalent to about 88 round-trips between LAX and SFO.<p>- If the LAX-SFO air corridor becomes too busy, that $64 billion could also be spent upgrading existing fleets by buying 147 brand new A380s at an average list price of $435 million each. [2]<p>- If the environmental impact is a concern (not that laying tracks and punching holes through the Central Valley is free of impact), then buy new Teslas instead.  Lots of them.  At $35,000 per Model 3, you could buy 1.8 million new Teslas using that money.  Add some solar panels to each purchase and you could still buy more than a million -- more than enough for every San Franciscan to get a brand new Tesla.<p>[0] <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.mercurynews.com&#x2F;2017&#x2F;01&#x2F;13&#x2F;confidential-report-california-bullet-train-could-cost-billions-more-than-expected&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.mercurynews.com&#x2F;2017&#x2F;01&#x2F;13&#x2F;confidential-report-c...</a><p>[1] <a href=\"http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.opshots.net&#x2F;2015&#x2F;04&#x2F;aircraft-operating-series-aircraft-operating-expenses&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.opshots.net&#x2F;2015&#x2F;04&#x2F;aircraft-operating-series-air...</a><p>[2] <a href=\"http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.airbus.com&#x2F;content&#x2F;dam&#x2F;corporate-topics&#x2F;publications&#x2F;backgrounders&#x2F;Backgrounder-Airbus-Commercial-Aircraf-price-list-EN.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.airbus.com&#x2F;content&#x2F;dam&#x2F;corporate-topics&#x2F;publicati...</a><p>(Edit: added citation for $64 billion official estimate)</td>\n",

I use the latter whenever and wherever it is offered. As I understand it offers greater security than any of the above, and more importantly (life is short) it is much faster. (Though there is one wrinkle. Most point-of-sale systems process phone payments with just the tap. A few of them seem to instead treat it as equivalent to a swipe, and then launch you into a legacy multistep handshake thereafter.)<p>For reasons I don&#x27;t understand, the credit card makers have spent many years bringing the new chip cards to market, they include much higher technology than ever offered before, yet the payment process takes much longer. Of course these few seconds don&#x27;t matter that much per transaction, but think it might be enough to actually make a meaningful difference in staffing levels and line lengths at big stores in December.<p>I do understand the fees though. The credit card brands and banks have worked themselves, through years of diligent effort, into a business where they can impose a kind of &quot;tax&quot; of 3% on most of the retail economy across the entire US. This is obviously of immense economic value to them, and they will work very hard at every level to maintain it for as long as possible. On the other hand, paying these companies a 3% tax on every retail transaction is... rather surprising in the grand scheme of things, and seems unlikely to persist for that much longer.</td>\n",

We are not landlocked, there is plenty of water in the sea. Desalination is energy intensive.

Because the issuers are very clear about a few things:  When push comes to shove and it REALLY gets down to it, unless the merchant takes a physical swipe of the actual card AND has backup to prove it (i.e. an imprint of the physical plastic), the issuers will side with a consumer in the event of a fraud dispute.<p>So why, do you ask, do most merchants not bother taking imprints of the actual cards?  Because a visual verification and physical swipe is usually enough (for 99% of cases).  Instances of fraud via card duplication are rare, so it&#x27;s usually not worth the hassle.  But in some cases, it is.<p>My business runs large-ticket purchases though CCs (average is $2000), and we take super extra precautions when our customers buy from us.  We take magnetic swipes, visually verify, AND take physical imprints.<p>We&#x27;ve lost several chargebacks because of lack of doing this.

Some human beings in that cog (managers, directors, peers, etc) may allude to enabling developers to actually practice the “art” of programming but the bottom line is if you aren’t moving the needle economically for the company, you’re a liability.<p>Find comfort in programming outside of the corporate world and practicing the art but don’t expect the “industry” gives a damn about the how or why of programming, mearly the characters we punch onto the screen into cash. Once you come to terms with this, life gets a lot easier, less frustrating and you can actually find fun in the work (albeit, not necessarily “art”).</td>\n",

He noted on Bloomberg’s Odd Lots podcast in late May that when there’s no real constraint on hiring, “you hire someone, and the first thing that person wants to do is hire other people.” The reason is that “the more people who report to you, the higher your prestige, the more your power in the organization…So every budgeting process is, ‘I really want to hire,’ and that to me is the root of all the excess.”<p>I’ve seen this first hand. One place where I worked HR even had a table of team size vs manager compensation. When I pointed out that it may not be the best idea to directly incentivize managers to hire more people they were less than understanding. Of course it went totally out of control.<p>But sadly there just is no counteracting force (except perhaps mr Musk). When you apply for your next job as a manager they will ask you “How big was your team?”, and they won’t be impressed when you say “I managed to keep it down to four people”. It’s just something that resonates very strongly with the primitive side of our brains (“You say you were the chief, how big was your tribe?”).</td>\n",

You take an elevator or stairs down to a place with a few mailboxes, then step outside.<p>Outside, you have a narrow strip of concrete, possibly with a few trees, that you are allowed to inhabit. Beyond it is as asphalt with two ton steel contraptions whizzing past at speeds that will maim or kill you.<p>There are a few places you can go from here. There are a few parks, where you can have some green space, along with the sound of the steel contraptions. There are other strips of concrete throughout the city between the contraptions&#x27; domain and the buildings. There are places you can pay to be allowed to occupy for a time. There are places you are paid to be for some number of hours each day. And there&#x27;s the public library if you can reach it.<p>If you&#x27;re responsible for just you and have access to a ready stream of money, you can cobble together an okay existence from this. You escape into intellectual pursuits in your small housing box. You spend lots of hours at the place you are paid to be. You visit your friends&#x27; small housing boxes. You spend some money to have somewhere else to go from time to time.<p>If you have small children, this changes. Intellectual pursuits? They can&#x27;t read yet, so your only option is parking them in front of videos. It hurts to see their faces go slack and their motions grow spastic. You spend time taking them to visit their friends in other boxes and meeting their friends at the park. You breathe a sigh of relief when they enter school, since now they have a place to be analogous to the place you are paid to be. You can&#x27;t let them outside to play on the narrow strips of concrete. One false move and some yahoo in a steel contraption has killed them.<p>If you want families in the city, bulldoze the major urban cores and replace them with low rise cohousing communities. Cars are parked on the edge. Everyone lives in spaces that face onto communal spaces. Community centers become focal points in each block, along with lots of other public space, indoors and out, instead of turning it all over to commercial interests. Short of that, if you want to raise a family and you have the means, you buy your own place that has its own small park and inside space to play. Everyone is cut off and must own the same amenities because of the tyranny of commercial space and cars over the ground level of the city.</td>\n",

Scale back deployments in Europe unless Russia still is still a threat to western Europe.<p>3) The most amount of money the U.S. spends is Health and Human Services. The U.S. health system is a fucking mess. Somehow we spend the most on healthcare and get some of the worst societal benefits out of any industrialized country.

I welcome diverse castings in modern shows (though we don&#x27;t need every show to follow a template &#x27;diverse&#x27; casting). \\nA common counter argument is, well you can suspend your disbelief and imagine a dragon, so why is a diverse community in a small village not ok? It just feels less immersive. Yes, I can go along with it - but I&#x27;m not sure it works. It feels like the modern world superimposed in a fantasy setting. I&#x27;d prefer to be sent to an alien world.<p>It is problematic, as years of discrimination in the real world for women&#x2F;ethnic minorities were wrong and we should encourage equality in the corporate world. However the entertainment industry I wonder should in some ways be exempt. Maybe. One area where there isnt a discussion on &#x27;diversity&#x27; is music and also novels. This is because there are tons of tons of novels and music bands to listen to. No one cares if a particular band is &#x27;diverse&#x27;. \\nSo I wonder if the only solution out of all of this, is to have more shows - yes, make diverse inclusive European fantasy shows, but also make traditional european fantasy shows too etc. What I think will happen is that in such a scenario most European fantasy fans will choose traditional like shows. Because the story is more immersive and you are brought more into this old world. Maybe. Like I say, I&#x27;m still undecided.

Currently one of them asked one of the family members to stop using the word fuck because it makes her uncomfortable. The other one and I were playing Minecraft and I tried to explain the Nether to her as hell and she was like “wait is that a word I can say?” which led to us discussing when it’s ok and not ok to use that word. My girlfriend explained what “boss bitch” means to the kids recently in terms of dog mushing.<p>Some amusing stories: my oldest when she was in daycare made a pact with her classmates to go into the bathroom and say curse words because the teachers wouldn’t hear them in there. They even had someone on lookout when they did this. Words used were “poop” and “doodoo”.<p>That same kid when she was 4-5 came up to mom and asked “I really want to say a curse word”. Mom sent her to her room to say it no more than five times and come back. She did and that was that.<p>The other kid accidentally busted out with a periodic “what is this bullshit?” when she was much younger. She does not curse currently.<p>Words are words and censoring “bad” words is silly. You can’t censor meaning. “F<i></i>k you” is just as powerful a statement as “fuck you”. Especially if it censors words like “associating” or “Cummings” or “arsenal”. This is just fodder for the unnecessary censorship memes.</td>\n",

I have 10+ years of professional software dev experience so I&#x27;ve mostly been looking at senior dev positions. I haven&#x27;t used LLMs at all in my resume, cover letters, etc. I only apply to jobs that I believe I meet the requirements for and that I would likely accept if given an offer. How do I signal that 1) I am a real person 2) I really do have the job experience and skills listed on my resume, and 3) I really am interested in the specific job I&#x27;m applying for. Because doing this my hit rate has been abysmal. I&#x27;ve had maybe 10-12 initial phone screens (never an issue, I easily make it past these). Past that I&#x27;ve had maybe 3-4 interviews that get into the later rounds. From that I&#x27;ve had zero offers.<p>So why should I keep doing what I&#x27;m doing when it&#x27;s getting me nowhere? Why shouldn&#x27;t I switch to an automated &quot;shotgun&quot; approach that applies me to as many jobs as possible to which I vaguely fit the requirements? The only other way I&#x27;ve seen suggested to signal that I&#x27;m a real person with real experience is to know someone in the company who can vouch for me (which I almost never do).</td>\n",

I saw a very interesting mini-documentary on YouTube[0] not too long ago that kind of opened my eyes. The idea here is that places like Onlyfans, and to a lesser extent Twitch, monetize loneliness via parasocial relationships[1]. This is <i>fundamentally</i> different than being a fan of, say, an actress like Emma Stone, or an athlete like LeBron James.<p>Viewers (the subject) actually <i>believe</i> they have a relationship with the object (be they a pro gamer or scantily-clad model). To most well-adjusted folks with a healthy social circle, this seems kind of nuts, but parasocial relationships have a long and sordid history -- starting with the invention of the &quot;fireside chat&quot; on radio. Loneliness is a powerful motivator and the psychology here is profoundly interesting. At the end of the day, I&#x27;d say places like Onlyfans end up being net negatives for both the models as well as the fans.

In a world where cigarettes are  <i>so</i> terrible however, e-cigarettes end up saving billions in health care dollars and quality of life.<p>Of all the e-cig players, Juul (which is now majority owned by Altria) <i>is</i> the most reputable one — by far - they have by far the best technology, quality controls, compliance and regulation teams, etc.<p>Unfortunately before Altria acquired Juul it was a <i>terribly</i> ran company. People spend a lot of time discussing the chronic youth issues but the reality is that Juul never wanted to sell to youths or anything of the sort — they were just _so_ incompetent at operations that they couldn&#x27;t do <i>anything</i>.<p>They set fire to hundreds of millions of dollars on totally ridiculous projects plainly stupid ideas:<p>* A modular supply chain project with the idea that they could use manufacturing as a carrot for regulatory laws — this team was 50-100 people and had tens of millions of dollars in budget. Never did anything.<p>* All manner of vanity innovation projects: new battery technology, next and next and next generation projects, dozens of flavours, absurd marketing campaigns, rebrands, a $250k custom typeface, the list goes on.<p>* Hired McKinsey and Bain because the executive team (who were all ex-management consultants) wanted the company to move fast ....<p>* My personal favourite Juul story (ok I have a bunch) was that the company was so incompetent they didn&#x27;t do headcount planning — You could just hire as many people as you wanted if your random (often incompetent) VP was okay with it. Juul had 50-100 VPs so it was sheer chaos.<p>It got so bad that Altria had to step in and install their own CEO and axe <i>all</i> of the existing executive team (and lay off thousands of random employees) to try and right the ship. Altria are a very legit operational business — you may not like them but they know how to work with the FDA within strict regulation guidelines. If Juul is removed from the market despite Altria taking over they&#x27;re truly fucked.<p>In my time at Juul I have never worked with so many incompetent people. \\nIt was quite impressive but also incredibly depressing as someone that joined because the idea of creating a connected device vaping product to help switch Americans off combustible cigarettes was very compelling.</td>\n",

To preface this comment, I&#x27;m a user experience designer, and I&#x27;ve been doing web software development and design for over 20 years.<p>In reality, your conjecture turns out to be largely untrue. Visual design quality does have an impact.<p>Main principle you want to look up: the Aesthetic Usability Effect. Basically, users perceive your product to be more usable if it&#x27;s aesthetically pleasing.<p>&gt; Summary: Users are more tolerant of minor usability issues when they find an interface visually appealing. This aesthetic-usability effect can mask UI problems and can prevent issue discovery during usability testing. Identify instances of the aesthetic-usability effect in your user research by watching what your users do, as well as listening to what they say.<p>From <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nngroup.com&#x2F;articles&#x2F;aesthetic-usability-effect&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nngroup.com&#x2F;articles&#x2F;aesthetic-usability-effect&#x2F;</a><p>See also: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nngroup.com&#x2F;articles&#x2F;perceived-value&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nngroup.com&#x2F;articles&#x2F;perceived-value&#x2F;</a> (other ways users perceive value based on the UI)<p>Of course, this has limits. A rebrand or redesign that, all other things equal, is mostly the same quality as before probably won&#x27;t get much benefit. I&#x27;ve seen many redesigns and that tends not to be something people do—there&#x27;s usually a good bump in visual quality in the process.<p>So, regardless of whether you, personally notice the different functionality, many redesigns are actually a success at improving the perceived value, perceived usability, and overall evaluation of the brand, company, and product.<p>People aren&#x27;t idiots. They don&#x27;t do this work for no reason. Try to understand and respect the work outside your own department and specialty. Building respect across those boundaries is a rare and valuable thing.</td>\n",

You are building a small business. And there is nothing shameful about this. You are among solid companions with your local plumbers, restaurants, and barbers. You make a good living building a sustainable business that is growing steadily but slowly, to serve a small group of loyal customers.<p>But you are not a startup.<p>Startups are about growth. About chasing metrics like 5% week over week. About going from 100 customers to 100,000 in a month. That is the reason you take VC money. It&#x27;s not &quot;I have this idea for a business, but I need some money to quit my job while I work on it&quot;. It&#x27;s &quot;I have an idea for a business that could be huge but I need to build it up <i>fast</i>&quot;.<p>So when I see someone bemoaning the advice they were given by their investors, telling them they should be meeting all these crazy metrics, I can&#x27;t help but ask, what did you expect? The VC isn&#x27;t in the business of slow, organic growth of your company. They are in the business of generating a return for their fund within a relatively short timeframe. The advice you get is their best effort to try and help you find &quot;explosive&quot; growth.<p>Before you sign your bootstrapped business on for investment money, ask yourself: is this business, and more importantly am I, really suited for massive, short term growth?</td>\n",

This trick works because:<p>- promises hold on to their result value indefinitely (until they&#x27;re GC&#x27;ed)<p>- you can await (or .then()) an existing promise as many times as you want<p>- awaiting an already-resolved promise is a very low-overhead operation.<p>In other words, the promise acts as a mutex around the computation, and the resulting code is understandable even by people unfamiliar with mutexes, locks and so on.</td>\n",

Applicants can input their GPA, SAT scores, extracurriculars etc. to understand their acceptance rate at specific universities based on historical data.

It makes the argument that it takes time and the right conditions to build up an industry - infrastructure needs to be built, education and a skilled labor pool with the necessary know-how as well. To begin with, a fledgling industry in a developing country cannot compete with those of already industrialized countries - these are already so effective that they can undercut newcomers before they have time to become competitive. So the book argues that when developing countries are pressured into free trade agreements (for example by making aid dependent on this), these countries are also forced into a position where they get stuck at the low end of the production value chain, selling raw materials, while buying processed goods from others (often the same role they were forcibly assigned when they were colonies). So much like we allow children time to learn in school before we expect them to compete in the job market, we should allow developing countries to employ protectionistic policies like tariffs, in order to protect and build up their fledgling industries nationally, before fully entering the world market in a couple decades when they are ready.</td>\n",

Modules can do that job, and that&#x27;s the point of this blog post.<p>The second problem, scalability, is harder to solve at the language level in most languages outside those designed to be run in a distributed environment. But most people need it a lot less than they think. Normally the database is your bottleneck and if you keep your application server stateless, you can just run lots of them; the database can eventually be a bottleneck, but you can scale up databases <i>a lot</i>.<p>The real reason that microservices may make sense is because they keep people honest around module boundaries. They make it much harder to retain access to persistent in-memory state, harder to navigate object graphs to take dependencies on things they shouldn&#x27;t, harder to create PRs with complex changes on either side of a module boundary without a conversation about designing for change and future proofing. Code ownership by teams is something you need as an organization scales, if only to reduce the amount of context switching that developers need to do if treated as fully fungible; owning a service is more defensible than owning a module, since the team will own release schedules and quality gating.<p>I&#x27;m not so positive on every microservice maintaining its own copy of state, potentially with its own separate data store. I think that usually adds more ongoing complexity in synchronization than it saves by isolating schemas. A better rule is for one service to own writes for a table, and other services can only read that table, and maybe even then not all columns or all non-owned tables. Problems with state synchronization are one of the most common failure modes in distributed applications, where queues get backed up, retries of &quot;bad&quot; events cause blockages and so on.</td>\n",

They found that treatment and education are the most cost effective way to deal with the drug problem, and that prohibition was the most costly and ineffective means of dealing with it.<p>Therefore the government understands that the war on drugs is likely to be unsuccessful, and we have to ask ourselves, why do they persist with it? A few reasons present themselves: Ideological motivations, they just don&#x27;t like the drugs. The fact that if you terrify the population you can use that as means for greater political control and discipline. And the fact that Tobacco and Alcohol companies would likely suffer as a result of drug legalisation, like cannabis.<p>Lastly the CIA has been found to be involved in the drug trade on a vast scale. This is not a conspiracy, there are many well-documented books on this. They need large sums of untraceable money for clandestine operations, and drugs are an ideal source of this.<p><a href=\"http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.rand.org&#x2F;pubs&#x2F;monograph_reports&#x2F;MR331.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.rand.org&#x2F;pubs&#x2F;monograph_reports&#x2F;MR331.html</a><p>Noam Chomsky on the War on Drugs: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=Q-JX0yXDlh8\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=Q-JX0yXDlh8</a></td>\n",

Similarly, removing all dairy would lead to a reduction of just 0.7%.

Financing it. These programs are monumentally expensive. You need to get the money from somewhere. The easiest place to take it is via the money printer and the second is from the rich.<p>If you do it via the money printer, it&#x27;s a self-own in terms of inflationary impact.<p>If you do it by taxing the rich, you wind up hobbling and punishing your most productive citizens. Look at China&#x27;s economic situation right now to see how ultimately unproductive that can be.<p>2. Diminishing effects. A bit more money is great when everybody else in your local economy didn&#x27;t get it. But when everybody gets it, things just become more expensive.<p>The USA did this during the COVID era. We basically implemented UBI. We expanded the M1 money supply from $4T to $18T and largely handed it out in a diffuse way. For the first 6 months it was awesome. And then shortages started spiking and inflation started creeping in. We ultimately had to roll it back.<p>I don&#x27;t think these problems are fundamentally solvable.<p>Instead, we should foster competition, incentivize innovation, and let markets do their thing. This will create lower prices for basic goods and create employment opportunities so people can have what they need for cheap, under the financing of their own effort.</td>\n",

Rural life sat well with some of my peers, but I loved tech and quickly left through college enabled by my parents ability to point me in the right direction, which many of my peers didn&#x27;t have. The difference in opportunity I saw in the cities versus New Hampshire was staggering, not even comparable.

By forcing down interest rates and essentially moving spending from the future into the present, they&#x27;re stimulating investment in general. But what they forget (or more likely, choose to ignore) is that investments can be just bad investments.<p>Uber is a bad investment. There is no barrier to entry in ride sharing. Drivers can install multiple hailing apps. Riders can too. Building a real time ridesharing engine is not hard - I did it once as a prototype years ago but it was unfortunately in the pre-smartphone era and you had to find ride matches using your regular computer.<p>So central banks print money in order to buy up safe investments. That forces institutional investors to pour their money into risky investments like venture capital firms. VC firms look around at a field with slim pickings but that torrent of money has to go somewhere, so it ends up being used to fight vast unsustainable price wars. And in the end people&#x27;s savings that they will depend on in retirement don&#x27;t end up invested in productive assets that&#x27;ll yield ROI into the future .... their money ends up subsidising a 10 minute taxi ride and being lost forever.<p>The people who run Uber may feel that they &#x27;have&#x27; to do this otherwise their competitors would do so instead, but that just reinforces how hopeless the situation is: they know perfectly well that their main competitive advantage is illusory, or at best, is merely a result of better access to capital flows.

Of course, I&#x27;m young and single but by no means frugal. (I find that the little costs involved in worrying about my expenses easily outweigh the money saved.) So this is quite an income.<p>One of the main questions about something like this is about who would do boring, low-paid work with this sort of basic income. What I would really hope is that people would still do many of those jobs, but for far fewer hours--largely as a way to get money for incidental expenses and luxuries beyond the basic income. One problem I find with most jobs is that it&#x27;s much easier to get more pay than less hours, even if I really want the latter. There is a large drop-off between full-time and part-time work.[1]<p>Beyond a certain level, I would value having more free time far more than making more money. Unfortunately, mostly for social reasons, it&#x27;s hard to express this preference. A basic income could make this much easier to do.<p>While I suspect this might not pass, I think it would be very valuable for the entire world. One of the unfortunate realities in politics is that it is really hard to run experiments; small countries like Switzerland can act as a test subject for the entire world. Or perhaps like a tech early adopter for modern policies.<p>Either way, this passing would be very interesting.<p>[1]: For me, this is not quite as simple.

Really cool new services came online frequently. I still remember the first time I used Google, and at the time I was blown away by how good it was (&quot;like magic!&quot; I said) because the results were so much better than other search engines of the time.<p>But these days, the older I get the more and more I feel like tech is having a negative impact on both society at large and me personally.

Your body uses fats for all sorts of processes, and most importantly, your body understands and can use fats.<p>4) Sugar is part of a healthy diet. Nope, sugar is not necessary in our diets at all.<p>5) Salt is bad. In moderation, salt and other electrolytes are actually needed by our bodies (unlike sugar).<p>6) Lack of exercise is the reason people get fat. No...

A voice system that can do literally everything one can do with a keyboard and a mouse would be magical, but no system offers that.<p>Instead, it&#x27;s a guessing game about syntax and semantics, and frequently a source of frustration. There are many failure points: it can &quot;hear&quot; you wrong, it can miss the wake word, it can hear correctly but interpret wrong, miss context clues, or simply be unable to process whatever the request is. In my experience, most normal people either relegate voice commands to ultra-specific tasks, like timers, weather, and music, and that&#x27;s that. Google and Alexa are relatively good at &quot;trivia&quot; questions, but Siri is a complete failure. All systems have edge cases that make them brittle.<p>I think there&#x27;s potential here.

I get the sense that LLMs are trained on a very large data set all at once, but that it is difficult to incrementally update them with new data. Is that a true assessment? Even incrementally updating an inverse text index can be a scalability challenge, and so it seems like, given the way that LLMs are trained, that it would be even harder to do with LLMs without spending an absolute fortune on training.</td>\n",

While I&#x27;m no longer working in classrooms (pandemic plus other reasons led to this), I&#x27;m still producing content, which I think is of good quality and worthwhile.<p>The issue I have with it is that I refuse to produce attention-grabbing clickbaity titles or thumbnails.  I don&#x27;t like the whole algorithmically-driven race to the bottom of the brain stem, and have zero interest in producing the same.  I&#x27;ve had plenty of comments from viewers who say the videos are great and informative, but if I&#x27;d just jazz things up a bit then I&#x27;d get more views.<p>I&#x27;m just wondering how this will change (if at all) with this new program.  It takes a LOT of time to produce decent content, and even more if you&#x27;re going to provide a course and backup materials etc.. Writing curricula is HARD work, and writing tests, etc., that are actually valid is reasonably challenging and time consuming.<p>I currently get about £100 a month from YT, which definitely doesn&#x27;t reflect the time I put into it (but I know it has other benefits as I sell a fair number of books partly as a result of the viewership).  I know that the beasts of the platform (3b1b spring to mind) would do really well from this (and deservedly so), but I do wonder if things really need to change to make YT work well for genuinely-produced non-clickbait educational content.</td>\n",

This was very early in their trajectory, so I even sat down with Larry Page and chatted with him for half an hour.<p>A year or two later I’m in Tokyo and talk to a new Google product manager based there. I tell her it is insane that Google serves me Japanese pages on my English-configured PowerBook just because I am in Japan. It doesn’t matter that I read Japanese just fine… Making this determination purely based on my IP address is madness, I tell her.<p>Over two decades later, nothing has changed. Each year I spend several months abroad, and this is one of the most infuriating experiences I encounter. Google is the offender that frustrates me the most, but they are far from the only company to engage in this abhorrent practice. I am tempted to create an Internationalization Wall of Shame just to embarrass the companies that do this. (Not that I expect them to care.)<p>Why do they do this? My theory has always been that in any given country, there are <i>far</i> more native speakers with misconfigured computing environments than there are visitors and nomadic folks like me. So it’s merely a numbers game: I may be frustrated, but at least Google and other companies aren’t losing business when folks with misconfigured computers close the tab because they got a page served to them in, say, English instead of their native language.<p>I can’t say for certain whether this is the actual reason for this behavior. What I <i>can</i> say, however, is that I absolutely loathe this practice and actively avoid doing business with any company that uses geo-IP location to serve me pages specific to that locale.

Other than that, Redis, that happens to be a low level piece of code, just worked on ARM, with all the tests passing and no stability problems at all. I can&#x27;t relate to what Linus says there. If a low level piece of code written in C, developed for many years without caring about ARM, just worked almost out of the box, I can&#x27;t see the Ruby or Node application to fail once uploaded to an ARM server.</td>\n",

Both officers told me that I &quot;could be arrested for not having ID.&quot;  For clarification, I asked if it was a city, state, or national law, and the officers adamantly maintained that it was a state law. I, stupidly, thought to educate them on this misconception, and one officer in particular decided to bring me in because she &quot;knows the laws and doesn&#x27;t need to be told how to do [her] job.&quot;<p>I was brought into the local precinct (Brooklyn&#x27;s 88th).  When I arrived, both officers denied saying I was required to carry ID when I asked the captain about the law.  Of course the captain confirmed that I was not required to carry ID, but at that point it didn&#x27;t really matter anyway.  The charge was failure to obey a traffic signal.<p>I was held in solitary confinement for 10 hours.  During that time, the female arresting officer would periodically come by to taunt me, and tell me that I shouldn&#x27;t have questioned her, and then threw a huge tantrum when I requested not to be touched by her for fingerprinting.  They sent another officer in to do it, but for a moment, I honestly thought was going to beat the shit out of me.<p>The other arresting officer, a guy of Filipino descent, noticed my Filipino flag belt buckle when they were taking my belt (so I couldn&#x27;t hang myself, apparently).  We talked about the country a bit (I was a volunteer there for 2 years) and to his credit he apologized to me, admitted that he was wrong about the law, but said that there wasn&#x27;t anything he could do now that I was in there because the other officer wanted to make an example of me.  I was, curiously, allowed to keep my shoelaces.<p>The other officers that would walk by my urine soaked cell and ask why I was there did not believe at first that I had been arrested for running a red light.  When I mentioned who the arresting officer was though, they all gave a knowing sigh.  One told me that she was not at all respected there, that she had a huge temper, and that I should not have crossed her.  One officer went across the street and bought me a slice of pizza, which was nice.<p>Around 8pm, I was personally escorted by two other officers to a courthouse in downtown Brooklyn, where I was retina scanned and placed in a holding cell with around 10 other criminals.  Charges ranged from domestic abuse to armed robbery.  One man was on the floor going through drug withdrawals.  Everyone scoffed at the idea that I was there because of a traffic violation, and likely assumed I was making that up.  I talked to my escorting officers a bit and they also confirmed that my arresting officer was a bit of a joke at the precinct, and that I had been unlucky.<p>While at the courthouse jail cell, the officer that was watching everyone at one point began banging on the cell bars with his hands and yelling at the inmates, calling them niggers and going on about how they&#x27;re all in there because they never had any fathers growing up.  Some of the inmates laughed, but others were visibly scared.  When that calmed down and another officer came by to drop off someone else, I told him what had happened and his only response was &quot;so?&quot;<p>I was offered the chance to make a phone call, but the only number I even have memorized anymore is my mother&#x27;s, and despite knowing that my friends were probably scared to death looking for me, I wasn&#x27;t at the point of calling her.  She still does not know that any of this ever happened.<p>I was then given a chance to speak to my public defender through plated glass.  That took about 20 seconds.  She basically told me this whole thing was ridiculous, that I had likely pissed off an officer (I hadn&#x27;t told her anything) and that we were going to ask the judge to dismiss the charge and that the judge would do so.<p>At 11pm I went before the judge for about 5 seconds and the charges were dismissed and I was allowed to go home.  Unfortunately, I first had to walk back to the precinct to get my bike, keys, phone, etc.  Luckily it wasn&#x27;t too cold.<p>I had thought that I was handling things fairly well, but when I arrived at the precinct and was faced with the notion of going back in there, even as a free person, I began vomiting in the garbage can beside the steps leading in.  Dehydration and stress were probably the causes, and for a moment I feared being seen, in case they would arrest me again right there for something or other.<p>My phone was dead, so I couldn&#x27;t get ahold of anyone until I got home, but I was too tired and afraid to get back on my bike, so I walked back to my apartment.  When I finally did get back on the grid, I had found that my brother, girlfriend, and work colleagues had all been desperately looking for me when I hadn&#x27;t shown up to work, and had been calling hospitals and police stations.  They eventually did get a confirmation from the 88th precinct that I was there, which of course no one relayed to me.  My work was prepared to send their lawyer down, but my brother talked them out of it, thinking that it would likely make things worse for me inside (he was probably right, but go work).  I felt even worse for putting them through such an experience.<p>All told, I was in custody from around 10am to 11pm and I&#x27;ve learned a few things on the inside.  Knowing your rights doesn&#x27;t matter.  There are no repercussions to any officer for anything they say or do.  If they want to make your life hell, they can and will.  Carrying ID may not be required by law, but it will save you a lot of hassle and explaining if you ever do have a run in with the law.  You can either exercise your right not to carry ID, but you put yourself in danger of the wrath of an ignorant police force (I still don&#x27;t carry it).  Also, don&#x27;t run red lights on your bike.</td>\n",

Harvard is filled with the smartest people in the world, and perversely that makes it a dispiriting place to go to school.<p>At Harvard, the lower tier students are as smart as the top tier students at an average school. However, the lower tier students get just as discouraged at Harvard as the lower tier students at an average school. The result: They don&#x27;t get their degrees in math or science.  The problem is that even a smart kid struggles to keep up when competing with the uber smart. As a result, the kid feels inadequate and drops the degree.<p>This is crazy, because as Gladwell points out, a science and math degree  is the &quot;most valuable commodity any graduate can have in today&#x27;s economy.&quot;  He says that &quot;as as a rule of thumb, your odds of successfully getting a math degree fall by two percentage points for every ten point increase in the average SAT score of your peers.&quot;<p>So, if you&#x27;re a kid and you have a choice between, Harvard and the University of Maryland, go with Maryland because its SAT scores are 150 points lower on average. That means you have a 30% better chance at getting your degree. However, most people will still choose Harvard, even knowing this, says Gladwell. Why? Because we have an irrational attachment to certain prestigious institutions.</td>\n",

You may as well argue that the government should be subsidizing new Marvel movies, or Call of Duty, because those are popular forms of entertainment too.<p>&gt; Also the only way to stop these gifts to private companies is likely with a new federal law banning them. It is simple game theory. These businesses will go where the profit is. Any city or state that refuses pay will lose out until every city or state refuses to pay. The best way to force that is with a federal ban.<p>No. You can just...refuse to subsidize them. Seems to be working fine for Seattle, where IIRC the renovated stadium for their new NHL team was privately funded.<p>And if they do go somewhere else, what&#x27;s the downside? Seattle lost its NBA team a while back, which was a bummer for basketball fans, obviously, but otherwise what was the harm to the city or region?<p>Plenty of high prestige world cities like Tokyo or London or Paris aren&#x27;t known for their pro sports teams. They seem to suffer little for it.<p>For a while, the Olympics were able to basically threaten their way into huge subsidies from even developed countries, but this seems to have mostly gone away now, as everyone collectively woke up from the delusion that the Olympics were a major economic boon worth investing in. Sports team stadiums could easily go the same way.<p>edit:<p>Okay, obviously I should&#x27;ve picked different world cities as examples, but even taking those: Tokyo&#x27;s pro sports teams don&#x27;t have anywhere close to the foreign popularity that London&#x27;s EPL teams do.

(For anyone unfamiliar with it, <i>The Lottery</i> is considered a masterpiece of a short story, and is widely taught in American high schools.) The excerpts I pasted were almost universally painted red: bad writing, &quot;very hard to read.&quot;<p>Then I took excerpts of Isaac Asimov&#x27;s <i>The Last Question</i>, another celebrated English-language short story in a very different writing style. Red and yellow all over.<p>Knowing full well what it would think of James Joyce, I skipped over him to try Roald Dahl&#x27;s <i>The Great Automatic Grammatizator</i> -- red and yellow all over.<p>Lastly, for the sake of variety, I decided to try something simple and put in large swaths of one of the original <i>Winnie the Pooh</i> books. Finally, something it was mostly okay with! But only the dialogue. Anytime the author dared to write any description, red all over.<p>Seriously, don&#x27;t use this tool.<p>Edited perspective from comment replies to mine: the app is largely okay with Hemingway, which makes sense as its main intent is to make your writing <i>like Hemingway&#x27;s</i>. Also, if it is largely intended to be for business writing, then it makes sense that it would react poorly to literary writing. Both good points!</td>\n",

I used to write everything in Ulysses, a syncing Markdown editor for OS X and iOS. I paid $70 to buy the apps, but then the company switched to a $40 a year annual subscription, and as the dozens of angry reviews and comments illustrate, that price is vastly out of proportion from the cost of providing the software (which I might add, is entirely hosted on iCloud infrastructure).<p>I have noticed this as well, that a not-small number of software programs have turned from &quot;give us one money for this version&quot; to &quot;give us slightly smaller amount of one money per month, but do it in perpetuity if you want to keep going with the data you&#x27;ve entered.&quot;<p>That, to me, is crap and is incredibly frustrating, especially when the subscription model is coupled with a data lockout threat.

While free trade and disruptive technology is good for the professional class, it inherently increases inequality.<p>Frank argues that after the liberal shift, &quot;everyone&quot; now agrees to these pro-business, pro-Wall Street policies, but we don&#x27;t have to allow rapid disruption freely. We could do what Massachusetts is doing. We could have tariffs and bring manufacturing back. Policy can prevent the inevitable.<p>I learned about the book while vigorously researching Trump&#x27;s rise to popularity during the primaries.

Open plan makes it easier to ask questions. Those are &quot;disruptions&quot;, yes, but what the Cornell study found is that in open plan it&#x27;s actually easier to &quot;read&quot; a person and see if it&#x27;s an ok time to ask a question, and to quickly reply or say ask me later, and so forth, to efficiently manage those disruptions. Compare that to offices where you are <i>much</i> less likely to ask questions, knock on a door, etc., and where when it does happen it may turn into a much longer disruption.<p>2. They found it also gives us more courage to ask potentially &quot;silly&quot; questions. Which can be the genesis of good ideas and help us get unstuck, contributing to team creativity and productivity.<p>3. They noted that developer reactions to office plans are often biased towards maximizing personal productivity in order to maximize (short-term) personal benefit, whereas the company benefits from a balance of personal and team productivity. That&#x27;s a fancy way of saying we&#x27;d rather spend our time coding than helping others, so we may not instinctively appreciate the benefits of open plan as much.

This GitHub comment by Sindre Sorhus (author of over 600 modules on npm) is my favorite writeup on the topic:<p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;sindresorhus&#x2F;ama&#x2F;issues&#x2F;10#issuecomment-117766328\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;sindresorhus&#x2F;ama&#x2F;issues&#x2F;10#issuecomment-1...</a><p>TL;DR: Small modules are easy to reason about, and encourage code reuse and sharing across the entire community. This allows these small modules to get a tremendous amount of real world testing under all sorts of use cases, which can uncover many corner cases that an alternative naive inlined solution would never have covered (until it shows up as a bug in production). The entire community benefits from the collective testing and improvements made to these modules.<p>I also wanted to add that widespread use of these small modules over inlining everything makes the new module-level tree-shaking algorithms (that have been gaining traction since the advent of ES6 modules) much more effective in reducing overall code size, which is an important consideration in production web applications.</td>\n",

Specifically, housing affordability is 100%, entirely, a problem of artificial constraints on supply by city councils.<p>(1) Americans consider housing to be an investment. An investment is only an investment if you expect a positive return over time. We generally want that investment to match or exceed inflation.<p>(2) That&#x27;s antithetical to the idea of affordable housing. It&#x27;s either affordable <i>or</i> an expensive, appreciating asset. It literally cannot be both at the same time. The only reason it&#x27;s worked thus far is the broad-based expansion of the US economy and of specific population centers like SF has masked the problem for many, many years. Especially in conjunction with 30-year mortgages requiring 2% down. That&#x27;s some serious leverage.<p>We don&#x27;t talk about the lack of affordable AAPL shares do we? That&#x27;s insane, it&#x27;s an investment, we <i>want</i> it to go up. The less affordable, the better!<p>(3) Renters tend to be younger, transient and not vote. Owners tend to be older, wealthier, have deep roots in the community, and vote their asses off. They also aren&#x27;t huge fans of change. They vote their interests: whatever keeps their, on average, largest investment performing well.<p>If you want cheap housing forget rent control. Allow developers to build up as high as the infrastructure can sustain. Allow smaller units, too, micro-apartments like whatever that place is on Mission, Panoramic. It&#x27;s time to re-think the idea of housing as an &quot;investment.&quot; We need to re-focus the narrative to make housing much more utilitarian.<p>This is reflected in major housing markets around the world, like Tokyo. They don&#x27;t consider housing an investment, and they have some of the most affordable housing in any major metro in the world.

They might get excited, learn a bit of the problem domain and then go off and build something that kind of solves part of my problem. But then I&#x27;m stuck in a endless cycle of explaining the rest of the problem, to someone who isn&#x27;t really interested, then waiting for a new iteration and then evaluating how it doesn&#x27;t completely the solve the problem until the programmer gets bored and goes off to find something new and exciting to do with computers. Programming the computerwas always the end for them. They don&#x27;t actually care about the problem. I care about the problem. So for me computers are a tool to solve my problem. I might as well write the program myself because it&#x27;s less work to become a mediocre programmer than to intimately understand the problem.<p>My theory is that something like this happens in interface design. There are  designers who love to create beautiful designs, and we love that, but beauty is the end of it for them. They don&#x27;t actually care about the problem that the program (website, app, whatever) is supposed to solve. If they were stuck in a job filling out forms all day they would quickly learn the lesson to put the reset button out of the way. If they were intimately familiar with the problem, the better design would be obvious. And so it is that people with no &quot;design skills&quot; can point out the obvious mistakes of the designers.<p>It&#x27;s also true that good design <i>is hard</i>. Starting with a blank sheet and creating something, let alone something good, is daunting. Perhaps the hardest part is having the humility to admit, &quot;I don&#x27;t understand the problem sufficiently&quot; and the empathy to care about the problem enough to learn it well.</td>\n",

The TV show is not faithful to the books.<p>That said: the books are fascinating, but they are almost more like historical documentaries then narrative fiction. It works well because they are _short_ stories, and following the span of history, frequently jumping ahead a generation, is cool. But it would’ve been very difficult to render that as-is for television and have much of an audience. Also, the original stories were written in the 1940s and some parts feel quite dated (everyone is smoking all the time, the hyper focus on nuclear power, the relative role of women). So whoever picked the stories up, they were going to make a lot of changes.<p>If you think of the series merely as “inspired by” them not “based on them,” then the show isn’t <i>bad</i>. It has some corny flaws like most TV (the combat, just terrible), but they’ve developed a few good characters, added some new mysteries, and the order in which they’re unfolding events over time is interesting.<p>So, is it a classic? No. Is it faithful to the books? Not at all. But IMO it’s decent sci-fi, and interesting enough to watch if you’re bored :)</td>\n",

Instead of building a better experience, these engineers seem to be focused on sabotaging alternatives in the name of profit or control.

Take away our ability to import talent and there goes the last leg of American dominance in technology.<p>No more American students that can compete with Chinese, Taiwanese, Japanese, or German ones, leading to less innovation in a generation. No more immigrant students making their money and starting their businesses here (or working for American R&amp;D departments) because they can&#x27;t get a visa - and possibly even worse, well-trained highly educated Americans leaving because of the obvious end-game (reduced GDP causing all sorts of ripple effects in local economies, safety, etc).<p>I just don&#x27;t understand why we wouldn&#x27;t want to make it as easy as possible to steal talent that another country invested in. We take a 23yo Chinese engineering graduate as he&#x27;s going to begin peak productivity - the USA didn&#x27;t have to invest in his k-12, scholarship his university, clean the water he drank for 24 years, etc. Instantaneous social profit. He joins Chevron and is turning a profit for them within the year, pumping out research and getting taxed on his 100k&#x2F;year salary, spending his money in-country and oh well, maybe he sends a bit (already taxed) home.<p>Am I being reductive? Seems to be a very poor investment to make it harder for the highly educated to come into this country, without at the very least making a massive push for higher education across the board for our own citizens (which we are not seeing).<p>EDIT: To clarify my points: There are 2 ways for a country to be technologically advanced - train their own citizens, or steal other trained citizens. Have neither of those and obviously, you will fall behind.</td>\n",

Yes, decentralization will be in effect for niche groups but I don&#x27;t see it becoming mainstream.<p>To purposely be provocative to spur discussion, I will make a bold claim:  <i>Decentralization is an unstable equilibrium.  It&#x27;s the centralization that becomes the stable status quo.</i><p>If tpcip protocol and http protocol are <i>already decentralized</i>, why do we have centralized services that have &quot;too much power&quot; such as Facebook&#x2F;Google&#x2F;Youtube?  It&#x27;s because different actors can <i>spend more money</i> on their particular http node than other http nodes.  Those <i>unequal economic forces</i> is what makes decentralization tend towards centralization.  There is no technical protocol specification that can prevent that.<p>E.g. if Git protocol is decentralized, why is there so much concentration on Github?  It&#x27;s because John doesn&#x27;t want to install a git server on his laptop and punch a DMZ hole through his home router and leave his laptop up &amp; running 24 hours a day to serve up his git repo.  He&#x27;d rather spend the weekend playing with his children.  And Jane doesn&#x27;t want to spend $30 on a Raspberry Pi and install Gitlab on it to serve up her git repo.  Multiply John and Jane&#x27;s by a million other devs with their own various reasons for not serving up their git repos in a decentralized manner and the emergent phenomenon you get is something like Github.<p>See the trend?  Centralization is a <i>natural outcome</i> of millions of people not wanting to (1) spend money and (2) not wanting to spend extra time -- to fulfill ideals of decentralization.<p>I wish we would discuss the above factors much more often and there were more articles about it.</td>\n",

Can you imagine if all of a sudden Google apps start performing better than anyone else&#x27;s?&quot;<p>This is already happening. I very recently worked on the Edge team, and one of the reasons we decided to end EdgeHTML was because Google kept making changes to its sites that broke other browsers, and we couldn&#x27;t keep up. For example, they recently added a hidden empty div over YouTube videos that causes our hardware acceleration fast-path to bail (should now be fixed in Win10 Oct update). Prior to that, our fairly state-of-the-art video acceleration put us well ahead of Chrome on video playback time on battery, but almost the instant they broke things on YouTube, they started advertising Chrome&#x27;s dominance over Edge on video-watching battery life. What makes it so sad, is that their claimed dominance was not due to ingenious optimization work by Chrome, but due to a failure of YouTube. On the whole, they only made the web slower.<p>Now while I&#x27;m not sure I&#x27;m convinced that YouTube was changed intentionally to slow Edge, many of my co-workers are quite convinced - and they&#x27;re the ones who looked into it personally. To add to this all, when we asked, YouTube turned down our request to remove the hidden empty div and did not elaborate further.<p>And this is only one case.</td>\n",

You knew exactly what route they were taking.<p>People talk about how Uber&#x2F;Lyft dodged taxi regulation, which is true, but the reason there was so much regulation around taxis in the first place was <i>because the old system was so ripe for abuse.</i> Imagine being a tourist landing at an airport and taking a taxi to your hotel; what if you got into a cab and they charged a hidden $20 &quot;airport pickup fee,&quot; or took the scenic route, or simply charged a higher rate than the car in front of them? That&#x27;s exactly why the industry was so tightly regulated, and you have things like standardized rates, requirements for rates to be displayed on the interior and exterior of every cab, the meter being visible to the rider, etc.<p>All this to say, any sort of competition on pricing is totally orthogonal to competition on product.

They are disgusting.<p>While sitting around waiting for 20 minutes &quot;cooking&quot; in a dealership waiting for the man to come back with a price for a used car, I heard 4 other salesman standing around, pretending to be customers, laughing and making fun of people who had come in to buy a car.

These days the only blogs I trust are the ones I see on the top of HN or lobsters, which is unfortunate because I have interests beyond tech and I find it very, very difficult to find good blogs I can read about those interests.<p>I think that shows there is a problem with blogging that goes beyond just the medium. Consider that blogging is a decentralised ecosystem, so you have no central place for discovery outside of Google specifically and search generally. Being on the top of Google is an attractive proposition because it means many eyeballs and lots of ad revenue. Therefore it is natural that many new blogs exist to game the search engine, hence the term &quot;blogspam&quot;.<p>Some of the same incentives exist with large social media sites as well, but on Twitter and the like if you mute&#x2F;block enough big people and follow only those you care about, your feed will eventually become clean enough to look at every day. So I think it is much more important to solve the <i>discovery</i> problem with blogs if you want them to get more traction.</td>\n",

Until you can satisfactorily answer that, there shouldn’t be any change. Stop changing the UI like you’re working at Hermès. It’s not fashion.

I also recall discovering increased moral agency -- as a Christian I had been taught I could simply confess whatever and it would be forgiven (an idea I found laughable), and that the objective basis for making moral judgements comes directly from god (another idea I found laughable). As an atheist I was suddenly responsible for making my own moral judgements and conclusions (I had to decide upon my own objective basis for making moral judgements), and forgiveness was something I had to work towards myself (as in I had to forgive myself for things, which is not easy, but is incredibly rewarding) versus simply getting it for free from some nonexistent deity.

But there is no discussion of the platform which to me is actually the highest value proposition Apple is bringing here.<p>In short: Apple has made a fully realized spatial operating system, while Meta has made an app launcher for immersive Unity&#x2F;Unreal apps for vanilla Android. You can get away with an app launcher when all you want to support is fully immersive apps that don&#x27;t talk to each other.

The operating system has to truly understand 3D concepts internally.

Often they try and suck it up, which leads to all kind of issues down the line.<p>There is another way, which is negotiating and clearly stating one&#x27;s goals.

As a reminder, there is not a single LLM on the market today that is not vulnerable to prompt injection, and nobody has demonstrated a fully reliable method to guard against it. And by and large, companies don&#x27;t really seem to care.<p>Google recently launched a cloud offering that uses a LLM to analyze untrusted code. It&#x27;s vulnerable to prompt injection through that code. Microsoft Bing still has the ability to be invoked from Edge on any webpage, where it will use that webpage content as context. It&#x27;s vulnerable to prompt injection. Plantr is advertising using an LLM in <i>military operations.</i> Multimodal LLMs offer us a new exciting opportunity to have prompt injection happen via images. And OpenAI had decided that prompt injection isn&#x27;t eligible for bug bounties because &quot;those are for problems that can be fixed&quot;, which is a wild thing for a company to say at the same time it&#x27;s advertising API integration with its product.<p>But sure, let&#x27;s have yet another conversation about AGI. The problem is that the only thing these articles do is encourage the public to trust LLMs <i>more.</i> Yes, spam is a concern; yes, the politics of technology on the workplace is always something to consider. But these articles take a naively positive tone towards LLM capabilities that glosses over the fact that there are significant problems with the technology itself.<p>In the same way that discussions about the ethics of self driving cars masked the reality that the technology was wildly unpolished, discussions about the singularity mask the reality that modern LLMs are frighteningly insecure but are nonetheless being built into every new product anyway.<p>It&#x27;s not that these conversations aren&#x27;t important, I do think they&#x27;re important. Obviously the politics matter. But the failure mode for LLMs outside of content generation is so much worse than these articles make it seem. On some level they&#x27;re puff pieces masquarading as criticism.<p>I guess the silver lining is that if you&#x27;re genuinely losing sleep about GPT-4 becoming a general agent that does every job, don&#x27;t worry -- that&#x27;ll only last until it gets someone&#x27;s bank account emptied or until some enemy combatant uses prompt injection to get a drone to bomb a different target.

I&#x27;ve done hundreds of technical interviews here, and I also teach a class to train employees how to interview. I&#x27;m also involved in evaluating candidates who have gone through the interview process.<p>In my position, I get the occasion to read a ton of assessments written by interviewers. Some of the most striking assessments are the ones where the interviewer is cock-sure that they completely nailed the candidate&#x27;s utter and complete incompetence. It&#x27;s usually an interviewer who&#x27;s been asking the same question dozens of times over a year or more. They&#x27;ve seen every variation of performance on the question, and they&#x27;ve completely forgotten what it was like for <i>them</i> when they first encountered a question like that.<p>It&#x27;s total lack of empathy at that point, and if the candidate doesn&#x27;t exude near-perfect interviewing brilliance on that specific question, the interviewer judges them as essentially worthless. Interviewers like that sometimes even get snarky and rather unprofessional in their writeup, &quot;Finally, time ran out, mercifully ending both my and the candidate&#x27;s misery.&quot;<p>If I were to diagnose one of the causes of this phenomenon, I&#x27;d say it is bias. The interviewer best remembers the candidates who performed exceptionally well on their question, triggering the availability heuristic.<p>There are tactics that I think can be effective to bust those biases. One might be to put an upper limit on the number of times an interviewer is allowed to ask any given question. Once they&#x27;ve asked maybe 20 or 30 candidates the same question, it&#x27;s spent. They have to move on to something substantially different.<p>There are some other experiments I&#x27;d like to run. One of them is to have interviewers go through a one-hour interview themselves for every 50 or so interviews they give. Maybe match up an interviewer who has a track record of being especially harsh on candidates for not giving a flawless performance on the question they&#x27;ve been asking for a while.

We can show that support by facilitating safest protesting practices without detracting from demonstrators&#x27; ability to gather and demand change. This should not be confused with a permissive stance on all gatherings, particularly protests against stay-home orders.&quot;<p>Why are many taking this position? One can recognize that the protests are risking an increase in virus transmission while still recognizing that it is a risk worth taking. Don&#x27;t tell us there is no risk from these protests, but there is a risk from stay-at-home protests. The virus is not selective of political beliefs. It completely ruins the credibility of many health professionals. Almost no one&#x27;s opinions will be swayed either way if they acknowledged that the protests do carry a real risk of transmission.<p>[0] <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.cnn.com&#x2F;2020&#x2F;06&#x2F;05&#x2F;health&#x2F;health-care-open-letter-protests-coronavirus-trnd&#x2F;index.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.cnn.com&#x2F;2020&#x2F;06&#x2F;05&#x2F;health&#x2F;health-care-open-lette...</a></td>\n",

I also see people hired who are minorities but also great at their job. It&#x27;s not a binary pattern. But those who are hired just because they are a POC or female, yet are terrible at their job stand out. People notice it, but few say it.<p>Our company recently hired a black woman as a &quot;Software Engineer&quot; who can&#x27;t write a SQL statement. She has a &quot;taken some tutorials&quot; level of programming skill as far as I have noticed and produces things very, very slow. People notice this, and it makes them angry. I&#x27;m sure the other engineers talk about this even more when I&#x27;m not in the room. Our boss is proud of how much he is &quot;making the team diverse&quot; yet it&#x27;s only going to cause problems for the team.<p>I like to think I was hired based on my skillset, not to improve the numbers. I&#x27;ve worked hard to get here. People likely forget or don&#x27;t care how &quot;diverse&quot; I am when I am working because I produce. And I fully support bringing in diverse candidates, it&#x27;s essential to get those viewpoints, so long as they are a qualified candidate to start with.<p>I do think that men and women are biologically different and, it likely does contribute to a lack of interest in tech from women. Almost all of the women from my social circle are smart, pragmatic, driven and successful yet have zero interest in a technical career. They excel in their given industries but ours they want no part of. I don&#x27;t believe intelligence is more prevalent in either gender, but I do believe there are some traits that shape who we are.<p>That&#x27;s something that&#x27;s rarely addressed, for fear of being ostracized.<p>As far as his &quot;conservative white male&quot; discrimination claims, I&#x27;ve seen that too.

Perhaps the reason people don&#x27;t feel sorry for conservative white males is that if they are rejected by one company they can keep trying and will find an &quot;old school&quot; company that will hire them.

Let me defend the thresholds.<p>The point of this bill is to require beneficial ownership disclosure for shell companies. Legal ownership of an entity is one thing. The beneficial owner is the human who ultimately owns and controls the entity [1].<p>Tracing the beneficial owners of economically-active entities (<i>i.e.</i> not shell companies [2]) is expensive. Imagine doing this for Apple. You would need to look through every ETF that holds it to its mutual fund owners to their pension fund owners to their holding companies to their pensioners. That is a multimillion dollar exercise, largely useless and reasonably opposed. This expense in its extreme stopped similar legislation in the past. As a result, someone from Russia could create a BVI company that opens a Delaware LLC and gain near-total transactional anonymity.<p>This bill tries to exempt economically active entities. The thresholds are easy to identify, reducing paperwork, while low with respect to most companies. (Small businesses have simple ownership structures and a small number of beneficial owners.) The bill is <i>not</i> a general anti-money laundering bill. If you have employees and revenues, you are engaging in sophisticated money laundering.

For your ad-hoc queries you can replicate to another database for analytical purposes.<p>On this note, I have mixed feelings about Amazon&#x27;s DynamoDB, but one things about it is to use it properly you need to plan your use first, and schema second. I think there&#x27;s something you can take from this even with a RDBMS.<p>In fact, I&#x27;d go as far to say as joins are unnecessary for nonanalytical purposes these days. Storage is so mind booglingly cheap and the major DBs have ACID properties. Just denormalize, forreal.<p>- Use something more akin to UUIDs to prevent hot partitions. They&#x27;re not a silver bullet and have their own downsides, but you&#x27;ll already be used to the consistently &quot;OK&quot; performance that can be horizontally scaled rather than the great performance of say integers that will fall apart eventually.<p>&#x2F;hottakes<p>my sun level take would be also to just index all columns. but that&#x27;ll have to wait for another day.</td>\n",

All works must be registered in a government registry.<p>If it&#x27;s not in there it&#x27;s not copyrighted.  If you want to register a work from before the law passes, you have to prove you own it under the current system.  This would solve the orphan works problem -- if no one can prove they own it, it becomes public domain.  Basically, ownership should be recorded like actual property with a proper chain of title.  It would be published on a public ledger.<p>2. You must renew your registration every three years.  The fee for renewal will be X% of the revenue from the work, where X = years since first registration - 5 (edit: With a minimum fee of $100 to discourage hoarding useless IP).  First renewal is at 8 years.  Your registration fee would be recorded on the public ledger.<p>If you want to continue to derive benefit from your work you have to pay for the privilege.  After 105 years it will obviously no longer be worth it, but probably long before that.  This would be reported like income taxes -- you self report your profits but if the government thinks you&#x27;re cheating, they can audit you.  If you have multiple works in one product (think Marvel movies) then all revenue goes to the oldest work (that way you can&#x27;t avoid the fee by putting new and old characters together).<p>If you don&#x27;t renew, the work goes to the public domain.<p>How would you fix copyright?</td>\n",

I started out in fusion and switched to advanced fission. These days I don&#x27;t see why we don&#x27;t just build lots more regular old LWR fission reactors.<p>Imagining that somehow fusion is going to a) work, b) be cheap (fuel cost is only 5% of total nuclear fission cost so who cares), and c) not have the same stigma as fission is kind of weird in my mind.<p>For example, there are leaks of tiny amounts of tritium at some fission plants and people lose their minds. Fusion reactors will have many orders of mag more tritium. Will people not lose their minds just the same? Tritium is notoriously hard to contain since it&#x27;s so small. It can permeate through metal like a hot knife through butter.<p>Also, lots of people worry about fission and nuclear weapons proliferation. So does fusion get around this? Not really. In fact it&#x27;s worse. Did you know that the two materials you need to make thermonuclear weapons are tritium and plutonium? Tritium breeding is required by almost all practical fusion power plants (the other reactions are 100s to 1000s of times harder, I don&#x27;t care what x random fusion CEO says, they&#x27;re in it for the sweet billionaire side project money).<p>Plutonium is made by irradiating natural uranium from the dirt with neutrons. Practical fusion reactors have lots of neutrons. Really high energy ones too.<p>Anyway let&#x27;s just do fission you guys. It&#x27;s way easier. It has been working fine since the 1950s. It&#x27;s zero carbon. Waste problem is solved (see Onkalo, and reprocessing). It net saves millions of lives by displacing air pollution. It runs 24&#x2F;7 on a tiny land and material footprint. We have enough uranium and thorium to run the whole world for 4 billion (with a b) years using breeder reactors (demonstrated in 1952 in Idaho). Get the Koreans over here to build some ARP1400s or the Chinese to build some Hualong Ones until we figure out how to project manage again and then call it good.</td>\n",

Mathematics and programming are not really all that related to each other and I think there&#x27;s an overemphasis on the importance of math in programming for 99% of applications.<p>Sure, mathematical thinking can be useful, but it&#x27;s only one type of logical thinking among many types which can be applied to programming.<p>I&#x27;ve been programming so much for so long now that before I even start writing code my mind launches into an esoteric process of reasoning that I&#x27;m not confident would be considered &quot;thinking in math&quot; since I&#x27;m not formally skilled in mathematics. It&#x27;s all just flashes of algorithms, data structures, potential modifications, moving pieces, how they all affect each other and what happens to the entire entangled web when you alter something. Fortunately, my colleagues are often pleased and sometimes even impressed with my code, and yet I&#x27;m not so sure I would consider my process &quot;thinking in math.&quot;<p>So, this isn&#x27;t necessarily a direct refutation to the article. In fact, maybe what I&#x27;m talking about is the same thing as what this article is talking about. But, anyway, my point is that I feel that there&#x27;s more ways to think about problems and solutions than pushing the agenda of applying formal mathematics.<p>As an aside, I noticed this part of the article:<p><i>&quot;Notice that steps 1 and 2 are the ones that take most of our time, ability, and effort. At the same time, these steps don’t lend themselves to programming languages. That doesn’t stop programmers from attempting to solve them in their editor&quot;</i><p>Is this really a common thing?

Potentially break the cycles of bad parenting that have been running in families for a long time (I write this as one such person).<p>I expect it will be hard (nay impossible) to institute a parenting license (like a driving license) in a democratic society. So instead have a strong incentive in the way of a financial grant for every parent who clears a parenting curriculum sometime before their child turns 1 (or some appropriate marker). Keep the freebees &#x2F;incentives piling on during the kids childhood so parents are motivated to undertake &quot;continuing education&quot;<p>Parenting is truly important stuff - for many parents it is the most important responsibility we&#x27;ll ever have in our lives- but we seem to leave it to chance to get the right outcomes.</td>\n",

Advertising is ultimately a doomed business model as it works against your users&#x27; interests, yet requires those users to willingly use the product and engage with the ads.<p>Over time, users learn to ignore it (see &quot;banner blindness&quot;) so a short-term response is just to include more ads to compensate, but there&#x27;s only so much space before the entire product becomes saturated with ads and users leave completely because the inconvenience of advertising became greater than the value the product provides. Regulators are also wisening up to it with stronger privacy protections (that threaten non-consensual ad-targeting) all around the world.<p>Advertising is a time bomb and an unsustainable business model. It provides short-term revenue (and <i>a lot</i> of it if you play your cards right, as Meta&#x27;s stock price until now reflects) but will never be sustainable in the long run. Advertising is a parasite and its host will always try to get rid of it - a pretty terrible business model when you can instead align the incentives by charging your users money and provide them a valuable service in exchange.<p>Is there value in Facebook&#x27;s products (whether current, or future VR-based ones)? Yes. Is there enough value to justify a overinflated stock price that only got there due to a combination of monopoly position as well as temporary gap in regulation against spyware?

However, Sam doesn&#x27;t understand the ATProto very well and I want to clear it up a bit.<p>Before I do, let me just say: Bluesky and the AT Proto are in beta. The stuff that seems incomplete or poorly documented <i>is</i> incomplete and poorly documented. Everything has moved enormously faster than we expected it to. We have around 65k users on the beta server right now. We _thought_ that this would be a quiet, stealthy beta for us while we finished the technology and the client. We&#x27;ve instead gotten a ton of attention, and while that&#x27;s wonderful it means that we&#x27;re getting kind of bowled over. So I apologize for the things that aren&#x27;t there yet. I haven&#x27;t really rested in over a month.<p>ATProto doesn&#x27;t use crypto in the coin sense. It uses cryptography. The underlying premise is actually pretty similar to git. Every user runs a data repository where commits to the repository are signed. The data repositories are synced between nodes to exchange data, and interactions are committed as records to the repositories.<p>The purpose of the data repository is to create a clear assertion of the user&#x27;s records that can be gossiped and cached across the network. We sign the records so that authenticity can be determined without polling the home server, and we use a repository structure rather than signing individual records so that we can establish whether a record has been deleted (signature revocation).<p>Repositories are pulled through replication streams. We chose not to push events to home servers because you can easily overwhelm a home server with a lot of burst loads when some content goes viral, which in turn makes self hosting too expensive. If a home server wants to crawl &amp; pull records or repositories it can, and there&#x27;s a very sensible model for doing so based on its users&#x27; social graph. However the general goal is to create a global network that aggregates activity (such as likes) across the entire network, and so we use large scale aggregation services to provide that aggregated firehose. Unless somebody solves federated queries with the sufficient performance then any network that&#x27;s trying to give a global view is going to need similar large indexes. If you don&#x27;t want a global view that&#x27;s fine, then you want a different product experience and you can do that with ATProto. You can also use a different global indexer than the one we provide, same as search engines.<p>The schema is a well-defined machine language which translates to static types and runtime validation through code generation. It helps us maintain correctness when coordinating across multiple servers that span orgs, and any protocol that doesn&#x27;t have one is informally speccing its logic across multiple codebases and non-machine-readable specs. The schema helps the system with extensibility and correctness, and if there was something off the shelf that met all our needs we would&#x27;ve used it.<p>The DID system uses the recovery key to move from one server to another without coordinating with the server (ie because it suddenly disappeared). It supports key rotations and it enables very low friction moves between servers without any loss of past activity or data. That design is why we felt comfortable just defaulting to our hosting service; because we made it easy to switch off after the fact if&#x2F;when you learn there&#x27;s a better option. Given that the number one gripe about activitypub&#x27;s onboarding is server selection, I think we made the right call.<p>We&#x27;ll keep writing about what we&#x27;re doing and I hope we change some minds over time. The team has put a lot of thought into the work, and we really don&#x27;t want to fight with other projects that have a similar mission.</td>\n",

You guys are splitting hairs right now when talking about the difference between tweeting and boosting or public companies vs open source or what have you. None of that attracts users. If you have no users, then for regular people, your product is useless. Even the article is not really making a pitch for mastodon that indicates any features at all that would convince any of Kim K or Kylie Jenner&#x27;s followers to go take a look at it. I&#x27;ll even go a step further and say that Mastodon is probably more for fringe groups than for the unwashed masses those fringe groups are trying to influence.<p>Look, you want me to get excited about Mastodon? Show me something exciting I can do with it that I can&#x27;t do with twitter, instagram, or Snapchat. Is there some triple-I indie game that Mastodon will allow me to play in my browser? (Or triple-A non indie? I&#x27;m not picky. Just don&#x27;t show me a point and click please.) Post the link for that game, you&#x27;ll get a lot more people trying Mastodon. Alternatively, is there some new and novel porn that Mastodon will allow me to access? Or is there a new generation of FIFA stars on Mastodon? Or new generation of NBA stars? I mean, even a new generation of &quot;It&quot; Girls chasing NBA stars would be better for attracting users than &quot;thoughtful and local uncommented retweets&quot;. Which is not only what you&#x27;re asking me to get excited about right now, but is likely not even true. Boosts will be no more thoughtful than retweets, likely a good deal less thoughtful since Mastodon seems to be on a road that relegates it to fringe groups.<p>Right now, it&#x27;s like buying a large tract of land in Kansas and saying that you&#x27;ve started a new municipality. No we don&#x27;t have beaches, or theaters, or parks, or much of anything else, but everyone here is more thoughtful. so we&#x27;re <i>much</i> better than Miami, San Diego, or Minneapolis.<p>I mean, it <i>might</i> work? But I think Las Vegas hit on a much better method of populating empty area by just saying, &quot;HEY! We&#x27;ve got gambling and naked women!&quot;</td>\n",

Their power to do this or to forbid that is highly discretionary and essentially boundless.<p>This in turn gives a gatekeeper role to the regulators: you play by their rules or you don&#x27;t play. And that means they have final say over what happens across the internet, at least within U.S. jurisdiction.<p>So today they say net neutrality rules.<p>Tomorrow maybe it is price controls in the name of consumer fairness. Or maybe it is mandated compliance with government snooping orders in the name of national security. Or who knows what not?<p>Why not? With a utility-style regulatory framework, you essentially have a form of administrative law run wild, legally speaking. Standards are exceedingly vague, power is wildly broad, and (in the end) he who has the most power and pull to control the regulators winds up having the final say over what the law is or is not as it affects the internet.<p>This is the exact antithesis of the largely hands-off idea of what the government could do with respect to the internet over the past several decades.<p>Of course law tends to conform in the short term to what people want and, today, most people truly do want a free and open internet. Therefore, the risk of any existential threat to internet freedom is either minimal or non-existent <i>in the short term</i>.<p>But if your idea of preserving maximum internet freedom is in effect to place a loaded gun to its head and then declare it is not a problem because it is the good guys who control it and who therefore will use it only for good purposes, then you have what you want with utility-style regulation of the internet.<p>It might just work great as long as the good guys are in control. But what happens when it changes some day? And, if you think it cannot, then you have far, far more faith in human nature than I can possibly summon.<p>Welcome to the brave new world.</td>\n",

Tesla, years later, discovers that even though the hardware for a 90 was installed it should have been software limited to be a 60. (I&#x27;m assuming that Tesla only made the owner pay the cost of the 60 battery swap even though they replaced it with a 90). They go and &quot;fix the glitch&quot; and set it back to the 60. Since the new owner bought it thinking it was a 90, because it was enabled to be a 90, presumably paid for it assuming this was the case and is now upset because they don&#x27;t have what they thought they bought.<p>Sounds like all around bad decisions. The previous owner shouldn&#x27;t have sold it as a 90 or at least disclosed that, &quot;It&#x27;s a 60 but Tesla swapped out the batter with a 90 and left it configured as a 90&quot;. Tesla, being notified, should have just enabled the 90 and made the customer happy. How exactly are people supposed to abuse this? Tesla put the 90 in there and they&#x27;re the only ones who are going to be doing that. Presumably this cost them a fortune to do it in the first place. Why not get some good will out of it? &quot;Hey sorry about your battery. We only had a 90 so we threw that in there. Enjoy.

Is it due to fundamental economic drivers, or is it merely correlated with major historical events (internet 2000s, globalization 1990s, deregulation 1980s, post-WW2 society 1950s, etc)?<p>If technological society does not continue to innovate at the pace of the last few decades, will boom&#x2F;busts smooth out at a point of slower growth?<p>[0] <a href=\"http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.investopedia.com&#x2F;terms&#x2F;b&#x2F;businesscycle.asp\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.investopedia.com&#x2F;terms&#x2F;b&#x2F;businesscycle.asp</a></td>\n",

They also have the nerve to attack them in their own backyard where they can take advantage of German suppliers etc. What will be next? A Gigafactory in Europe?<p>This is great news for people who like tech but must be worrying for the German automakers who have yet to come up with a trustworthy answer to Tesla.<p>I believe one of VW, Mercedes Benz and BMW will bankrupt in 5-10 years. None of them have taken EV serious yet and I fear it&#x27;s soon too late. The EVs that they have come up with as answers to Tesla are almost cartoonish like vehicles.

I bet they will come with a space suit and a laser gun as well.<p>Both are still concept cars but they represent what they expect their EVs should look like. Mind you that this is something they plan to market in 2020 so it will probably be 2021 or later. And their planned 2020 EVs are inferior to Tesla model S, X and 3 in 2016&#x2F;2017 in many ways, not just design wise. It is as though they think only hipsters will drive EVs in any foreseeable future.<p>So when in 2021 they realise that they underestimated that ordinary people want an EV that looks no more spacey than a combustion engine car, but comes with wireless upgrades, long range batteries, large trunk, fast acceleration, high safety rating etc., they will have to wait another 3-4 years until they have a real answer ready. By then, model 3 has been on the market for close to a decade and even better Tesla models with better range, faster charging etc. have been introduced. And the Tesla cars will have been trained with tens of billions of miles of self driving by then. How are the Germans going to catch up?</td>\n",

(Green peppers are nasty and food-destroying in my opinion, which immediately removes over half the vegetarian options out there, just as an example), so I consider myself a decent bellweather for people who like the tastes of meat but want to actually eat less of it for various reasons.<p>The options that already exist today are quite varied.  Boca, Morningstar, Beyond Meat, and Quorn are all big names that offer meat alternatives that taste VERY different from each other.  Most of my meat eating friends won&#x27;t even try any of these, sight unseen.  (When they see them, they tend to have even more reluctance).  So, while I think it&#x27;s absolutely worthwhile to make alternatives that seem more &quot;real&quot;, there is still a stigma to overcome just by virtue of being fake.  And in america, at least, where meat-eating is tied to masculinity and bacon is worshipped, that&#x27;s a tough stigma to shake.<p>Decent imitations of highly processed meat exist already - I&#x27;ve had chicken nuggets that meat eaters had no idea were fake, and I fed my in-laws a &quot;turkey loaf&quot; dinner for Thanksgiving for years without them realizing - but matching the taste of &quot;quality&quot; meats hasn&#x27;t yet happened.</td>\n",

Every hot &quot;language du jour&quot; which has come after Ruby has gone BACKWARDS. Lower-level, more systems programming oriented. Maybe even compiled. Static typing everywhere. It&#x27;s utterly baffling to me.<p>&quot;Why are you using Ruby? You should use…Rust! (Go! Zig! Fill-in-the-blank nerd hype!)&quot;<p>Lol.<p>What I <i>actually</i> want is a new programming language&#x2F;environment which makes <i>Ruby</i> look like programming pointer arithmetic in C by comparison. Something so advanced, so high level, that much of the time you&#x27;re really just describing patterns and flows and data models and extensions, and then letting the computer determine the most efficient way to develop those code paths and execute them.<p>Unfortunately, I&#x27;m a bit cynical on this front. I believe the reason this doesn&#x27;t exist is because it&#x27;s at cross-purposes with programmer nerd culture. Many programmers enjoy the nitty-gritty of low-level coding. They fear abstraction. They fear &quot;magic&quot;. They fear things like &quot;implicit imports&quot; or &quot;duck typing&quot; or &quot;many ways to express the same method&#x2F;function&#x2F;algorithm&quot; etc. because it&#x27;s all nebulous and fuzzy compared to the safe confines of deterministic math &amp; logic. &quot;If I declare that this variable MUST BE AN INTEGER, then it MUST BE AN INTEGER. The idea you could pass me a string instead? UNACCEPTABLE !!!#%@!&quot;<p>In other words, I don&#x27;t have high hopes that great UX for forward-looking developers will come from present-day programming culture.

We need to talk to artists, philosophers, linguists, psychologists, and other experts in social &amp; historical cultural dynamics. They can provide the insight we lack.

And Google would then hope that people would use their built in blocker rather than downloading a third party extension which would highly likely block there ads. And if people have a built in blocker that blocks the mostly bad ads, the people would start to hate ads less and be okay with &#x27;good ads&#x27;.

I remembered all the warnings from my school health classes about how hard it was to quit once you start, how there&#x27;s a physical dependence and all that. It was uncomfortable at times, and there were plenty of cravings to get over, but I was ultimately successful.<p>I can compare this to the couple of times I&#x27;ve tried to &quot;quit the Internet&quot; (i.e. social media, reddit, etc.). The problem is that there&#x27;s nowhere to run from the Internet. I can avoid tobacco stores, I can&#x27;t avoid my iPhone. For what it&#x27;s worth, I&#x27;d love to smash my phone and throw it in a ditch, but there are certain social and professional obligations that require me to hold onto it. I have to be able to check my work email on the go. I have to use Facebook to stay in the loop about social events because all my friends use Facebook to schedule those social events. I have to call my parents once in a while. One device is a tool for all of those, in addition to being an ultra-high-tech meme-box with which I can mainline information to make myself feel good. It is of course not all bad, but the wonderful connectivity of the Internet is inextricably wrapped up with the &quot;DoS Attack on Your Free Will&quot;.<p>To get back to the analogy, I&#x27;d like to think I was successful at quitting tobacco because I can avoid it. If I were giving someone tips to quit something, that&#x27;s the best advice I could think to offer: avoid it. If you want to quit smoking, wouldn&#x27;t it be preposterous to buy a pack of cigarettes and carry it everywhere? The temptation would always be there.<p>So it is with smartphones. When the best minds in attention capitalism are trying to pull me in every time I send a text message, how can I quit that? It&#x27;s always in my pocket, and I can&#x27;t simply throw it away because there are now certain expectations that I carry that tool with me almost everywhere I go. There is nowhere to run from this modern media, and that terrifies me.</td>\n",

VSCode is a code editor with some features that you’d find in an IDE, and extensions that can provide additional functionality – so if people are turning to VSCode for developing it may imply that developers don’t know what a fully-featured IDE can give them. In the web space it is understandable to use an editor as web developers are typically working with dynamic languages, and often use other tools like browser plugins to give them what they need.. But in Java, especially professional Java, you really get a lot out of a good tool that has integration with the application server and you can really use the analysis and refactoring and everything.</i><p>IME a lot of developers don&#x27;t like their IDE heavily coupled to backend servers and environments, but actually prefer the &quot;code editor + useful features&quot; approach.

I&#x27;m not trying to argue to stop anyone doing it, but I would really like to understand it better.<p>Many video games are essentially simulators of things that we&#x27;re prevented from doing in reality, because of the laws of nature or society. Whether that&#x27;s dropping blocks into place, building a city, chasing and eating ghosts, flying a plane, performing magic spells, or engaging in physical violence.<p>And there&#x27;s a never-ending push to make experiences more photorealistic, to make simulator even better. From that I can only conclude that people want to get as close to the experience of perfoming the prevented act as possible.<p>Chopping someone up is heavily frowned upon in real life, but perfectly acceptable to emulate in someone&#x27;s living room. Somehow the simulation escapes the taboo. And that escape seems to be absolute: In the range of violent acts you could commit, from a gentle nudge to grisly murder, simulation of the most extreme extent is permitted.<p>But if that&#x27;s the case, why is the realistic simulation of some societal taboos (e.g. physical violence to the point of murder) mainstream, but others (e.g. sexual violence in any of its forms) not? They are both very serious offences, but somehow one gets a free pass to let anyone pretend to do it, but the other not.<p>Is it a reflection on the ultimate limits of those taboos in the society that produces most of these games?

I worked on the Windows Desktop Experience Team from Win7-Win10.  Starting around Win8, the designers had full control, and most crucially essentially none of the designers use Windows.<p>I spent far too many years of my career sitting in conference rooms explaining to the newest designer (because they seem to rotate every 6-18 months) with a shiny Macbook why various ideas had been tried and failed in usability studies because our users want X, Y, and Z.<p>Sometimes, the &quot;well, if you really want this it will take N dev-years&quot; approach got avoided things for a while, but just as often we were explicitly overruled.  I fought passionately against things like the all-white title bars that made it impossible to tell active and inactive windows apart (was that Win10 or Win8?  Either way user feedback was so strong that that got reverted in the very next update), the Edge title bar having no empty space on top so if your window hung off the right side and you opened too many tabs you could not move it, and so on.  Others on my team fought battles against removing the Start button in Win8, trying to get section labels added to the Win8 Start Screen so it was obvious that you could scroll between them, and so on.  In the end, the designers get what they want, the engineers who say &quot;yes we can do that&quot; get promoted, and those of us who argued most strongly for the users burnt out, retired, or left the team.<p>I probably still know a number of people on that team, I consider them friends and smart people, but after trying out Win11 in a VM I really have an urge to sit down with some of them and ask what the heck happened.  For now, this is the first consumer Windows release since ME that I haven&#x27;t switched to right at release, and until they give me back my side taskbar I&#x27;m not switching.</td>\n",

Sticking to the original principles as laid out by Kent Beck results in fairly sane practices.<p>- When people talk about &quot;unit tests&quot;, a unit doesn&#x27;t refer to the common pattern of &quot;a single class&quot;. A unit is a piece of the software with a clear boundary. It might be a whole microservice, or a chunk of a monolith that is internally consistent.<p>- What triggers writing a test is what matters. Overzealous testers test for each new public method in a class. This leads to testing on implementation details of the actual unit, because most classes are only consumed within a single unit.<p>- Behavior driven testing makes most sense to decide what needs tests. If it&#x27;s required behavior to the people across the boundary, it needs a test. Otherwise, tests may be extraneous or even harmful.<p>- As such, a good trigger rule is &quot;one test per desired external behavior of the unit, plus one test per bug fixed&quot;. The test for each bugfix comes from experience -- they delineate tricky parts of your unit and enforce workign code around them.</td>\n",

Of course some amount of it comes from direct frustrations people have with the language design, but I suspect that doesn&#x27;t account for all of it.

The suggestion that easy to learn languages can be effective too is somewhat humiliating, as we get attached to the pride of mastering more complex languages, and the suggestion is that some of the struggling we went through was unnecessary, and that folks who wont struggle as much might be able to be effective too, in fact the suggestion is that maybe our pride was misplaced.<p>Theres also a suggestion, in the fact that Go has opinions, that other opinions might be &quot;wrong&quot;.

The UAW - auto company contracts of that era explicitly tied wages to increased manufacturing productivity. It still is somewhat accepted in Germany, but is dead in the US.<p>Part of what killed wage growth was the demise of Communism.  Communism was once a serious ideological threat to capitalism. From the 1920s to the early 1980s, there was real fear in the business community that communism might work. It might deliver a better life to workers.  There was competition in ideology, and capitalism had to provide an increasing standard of living or risk countries going communist. Communism never did deliver a better standard of living, but the presence of a competing system which more or less worked kept capitalism honest.<p>With the demise of the USSR, and China moving away from its strict communist roots, the competition disappeared. Capitalism became a monopoly. Then it started acting like one. There was no longer any need to deliver a better life to workers.<p>That&#x27;s how we got here.</td>\n",

When he did, he used his time to claim that Donald Trump was the only honest candidate in the race. He bundled millions of dollars of donations for Trump.

Europeans don&#x27;t skip wood because brick or stone is superior -- it&#x27;s because Europe is <i>largely deforested</i>. Europe doesn&#x27;t <i>have</i> wood for people to use at the same scale.<p>Second, wooden houses last a plenty long time. &quot;80-150+ years&quot;, as you put it, is entirely expected for a well-constructed wooden house. Neighborhoods that date from, say, 1850, e.g. in New England, have plenty of old wooden homes that people adore because of their character.<p>Third, wood construction has a ton of advantages. Not only is it less expensive to build, but it&#x27;s <i>tremendously</i> more energy-efficient when filled with insulation. Brick and stone homes are absolute <i>energy guzzlers</i> both in hot summers and cold winters. And remember, e.g. in New York State you&#x27;re dealing with 100°F (38°C) summers and -10°F (-23°C) winters. Insulation <i>matters</i>.<p>The idea that American homes are somehow lower quality or shorter-lasting because they&#x27;re built out of wood is a myth through and through. To the contrary, they&#x27;re built out of wood because that&#x27;s the <i>best</i> construction for local climate and availability.</td>\n",

The colour fills in and the label changes to &quot;Disable fnurbification&quot; again. Okay what are we supposed to do?<p>What&#x27;s happened is the designer has read a post on medium about accessibility and that screen readers don&#x27;t read out the colour of the filled in part of a toggle switch, and has decided to help by changing the label when the state of the switch changes.<p>The problem is now the label could either be describing the current state or be describing what happens when you flip the switch.

No way to be sure.<p>Postscript: Notice that whatever you decide is correct in the second case could change what you would do in the first case if the first type of selector is one that would change label when you toggle it.</td>\n",

DJs?), lower statutory caps for damages (the MPAA and RIAA already sue for a tiny fraction of the likely liability for many infringers), and punishing false copyright claims (the claims studios take to court are overwhelmingly not false; penalizing bogus DMCA takedowns wouldn't move the dials at all).<p>The real copyright reform is probably something like reduced term and compulsory licensing.

The people responsible are shielded from any real consequence (how many people at VW knew about this, and how many are going to jail over it?). This is not a minor squabble over regulations; this is a conscious decision, involving many executives within the company, to willfully cause environmental destruction that directly costs human lives and health.<p>This is one of those cases where the corporate death penalty is the only just outcome I can think of.<p>$15 billion looks like a large sum; and maybe it&#x27;s even enough to deter car companies from doing something similar in the future.

With high velocity of money and low balances the interest expense is minimal and, to the extent they use debit cards, the interchange revenue can be material.

It is clearly beneficial to everyone to live in a society where people are well cared for and have healthcare, public education, welfare, etc. There&#x27;s a reason failed states and unstable&#x2F;developing countries generally aren&#x27;t where people are looking to startup the next big tech company.<p>Third, any smart founder isn&#x27;t going to just sell 1% of their stock every year and pay the wealth tax with that. They&#x27;ll take dividends, or take out a loan against the value of the stock, or use some cash from other investments, or whatever, and maintain control of their company. Yes, over the long term they&#x27;ll lose some wealth, but not necessarily control of their company, unless that&#x27;s the decision they make.<p>Fourth, this effectively ignores that wealth is a thing that grows and compounds. If your wealth is increasing at 4% a year (very attainable for the class of people a wealth tax would affect) a 1% wealth tax really doesn&#x27;t have as big an impact on your long term wealth as this makes it seem.<p>Fifth, the idea that people &quot;will just move to another country&quot; is very silly.

Unless this supposes that no one wants to take advantage of one of the richest markets in the world because they <i>might</i> have to pay <i>a small fraction</i> of their wealth to the government.

What &quot;real life&quot; ? Standard deviation tells you how volatile measurements are not what mean deviation is. Those are both very real life things just not the same thing.<p>&gt;&gt;It is all due to a historical accident: in 1893, the great Karl Pearson introduced the term &quot;standard deviation&quot; for what had been known as &quot;root mean square error&quot;.

His whole recent book is like that. It&#x27;s anti-intellectual bullshit with many words and zero points. He doesn&#x27;t give any arguments, he throws a lot of insults, he misues words and makes up redundant terms which he then struggles to define.\\nThe guy is a vile idiot of the worst kind: ignorant and aggressive.

Almost there and the lemmings didn&#x27;t even notice it, distracted by the new and friendly Microsoft front, free upgrades to Windows 10 and centered Start menu in Windows 11.<p>Mark my words - Windows 12 will severely impede direct installation even of an user-space software, funnelling everyone to go through the store. That&#x27;s the end goal and we will all be there in a couple of years, whether we want it or not.</td>\n",

This predates the microcomputer era as we know it.  Punched cards were still common when the book was written.<p>A computer was to control a new assembly line for a car company.  They couldn&#x27;t get the software to work.  They called in an outside insultant.  The outsider developed a program that worked.  (It was more complex.)  The book was about the psychology part:  The original programmer says: &quot;How fast does YOUR program process a punched card?&quot;.  Answer: &quot;About one card per second.&quot;  &quot;Ah!&quot; said the original programmner, &quot;but MY program processes ten cards per second!&quot;<p>The outsider said, &quot;Yes, but MY program ACTUALLY WORKS&quot;.  If the program doesn&#x27;t have to work, I could make it read 100 cards per second.<p>Correctness comes first.

So the question is, should consumers be able to <i>knowingly</i> buy restricted hardware such as Prima Cinema?  They pay $35000 and own the computer but they <i>know</i> they <i>can&#x27;t sideload their own movies</i>.  They <i>know</i> can&#x27;t pick another &quot;movie store&quot;, or watch Youtube&#x2F;Netflix on it, etc.  The hardware has <i>anti-tampering</i> sensors so that it bricks itself if the owner tries to open it.  The hardware is a &quot;general pc&quot;.  It runs Wind River Linux.  I think the cpu is x86 but it might be ARM or something else.<p>You can&#x27;t argue that Prima Cinema should not be locked down (claiming anti-competitive behavior) because the paranoid film studios wouldn&#x27;t even license their content if it wasn&#x27;t. If a buyer wants to have 1st run movies at home, all those restrictions in place is they only way to get it.  It&#x27;s more restrictive than iPhone in that sense.</td>\n",

Granted, they don&#x27;t have Nintendo&#x27;s games, and they don&#x27;t have Steam&#x27;s massive back catalogue, but looking forward it does make a dedicated handheld gaming system harder to justify, or at least makes the phone easier to justify if you&#x27;re not buying both.<p>It also makes me really interested to see where Apple is going with Apple TV and the Mac.  With the game porting toolkit already announced (and the results people are already getting just using it directly to run Windows games), it seems like Apple really could eat at least some portion of the gaming market by already having a handheld (phone), console (Apple TV), and gaming PC (Mac) ready to go in the next few years.<p>I&#x27;m expecting the new M3 Macs next month to lean really heavily into discussing the GPU advances and (hopefully) announce a lot more support from big studios to bring more games to the Mac.</td>\n",

You don&#x27;t need a degree to put Ikea furniture together either. I don&#x27;t need programmers. I write programs to write programs. I need folks who know how to <i>think</i>... for <i>themselves</i> and <i>learn</i> and go out and find knowledge they need to solve problems and then solve the problems.<p>Until they are <i>done</i> solving the problem.<p>Not until they&#x27;ve given up.</td>\n",

Recently, I took a career-break and I thought I would use the newfound free time to learn all the things I was putting on the back-burner.

Without this last resort said corporations would need to either fire-sale off assets to pay the principle on these bonds or face a technical default.<p>Covenants on their other bonds mean that if the corporation defaults on any of their bonds, all of the bonds become callable.

They kill an absurdly high number of people per TWh; by most estimates coal is several hundred times more dangerous than nuclear.<p>Does that mean nuclear is just a totally great idea? No; the issue with nuclear is cost. Historically it has been quite expensive, but subsidised in opaque ways.

Can it?<p>The debate about nuclear is never ending, and yet at the same time, seemingly never focused on anything relevant.

So if we&#x27;re pitching slow, we&#x27;re setting ourselves up to lose and the speed-hackers are going to win.<p>Our goal is architectural soundness. I believe the biggest fallacy of our industry is we think the only way to get these is to go &quot;slow&quot;. Not true.<p>What we&#x27;re really saying is our industry is short on <i>skill sets</i>. With specific skill sets, you can build architecturally sound systems at no extra cost.<p>If I were to build a house today it would take me much longer than someone else because I don&#x27;t have the necessary skills. I might hurry in which case the house would be shoddy. Is the shoddiness of the house <i>necessarily</i> because I hurried? No. It&#x27;s because I didn&#x27;t acquire the required skill sets first.<p>The software industry has no such (practical) concept of the skill sets required to build architecturally sound systems. We have a bunch of well-meaning hackers, and as a result shoddy systems that decay into technical liabilities.<p>Our industry needs to solve this skill set problem. The challenge is that academia has a hard time teaching these skill sets, because they are so removed from the practitioner. And businesses can&#x27;t teach it b&#x2F;c it takes years and special experience to actually teach it. So it&#x27;s not advantageous to a business to teach those skill sets.<p>So how do we do it? And how do we organize an industry around <i>professionals</i> who know how to build architecturally sound systems and code? This is a very difficult problem for a world that has such high demand for code and such little understanding of what the professional skill set would afford them.</td>\n",

I&#x27;m Romanian and I&#x27;ll provide some more details on this:<p>The country has been a powder keg ever since the results of first round of the presidential elections, with Calin Georgescu coming out of nowhere to win the first round, with classical polling showing him below 5%.<p>The candidates need to report spending to a state organization overseeing elections and this guy reported that he spent nothing on his election campaign, which is impossible as there have been flyers with his face on them, plus ads on social media. This is against the law.<p>There are also a lot of TikTok influencers that have come forward claiming to have received payments through a third party company to present the candidate in a positive light, and the issue is that these videos should have been tagged correctly as &quot;electoral ads&quot; according to Romanian law, which did not happen.<p>With TikTok being owned by China and their imminent ban looming in the US, there is strong suspicion that state actors are behind this, pushing Calin Georgescu through the algorithm, though this is tricky to prove.<p>This is not a strong grass-roots movement supporting this guy, it was a targeted effort of massive network of bots spamming his name &amp; tiktok page on random videos on Romanian tiktok videos to push his popularity (this comes from the Romanian equivalent of CIA &amp; other security structures). Tiktok themselves when asked to comment have investigated themselves and found nothing wrong, though they do agree that there are bots on their network and they&#x27;ve removed millions of fake likes &amp; followers in Romania.<p>In a video posted this summer, Calin Georgescu expressed anti-NATO sentiment which he recanted after winning the first round of the elections. He has also previously declared that we could do with some &quot;russian wisdom&quot; and he&#x27;s a big fan of the Iron Guard (<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Iron_Guard\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Iron_Guard</a>), which killed a bunch of political figures in Romania during their time. This organization as well as other fascist groups are illegal in Romania.<p>Candidates have to declare their assets as part of transparency and it seems Calin Georgescu has not declared all of his assets, which is illegal. There&#x27;s also suspicions about money laundering, with a house he bought for 250K in 2006 and sold for 1M in 2011 which is unusual. This is somewhat besides the current discussion, just adding some context that this guy is not exactly squeaky clean.<p>A criminal investigation has been requested by The Supreme Council of National Defence, which is the autonomous administrative authority in Romania invested by the Constitution with the task of organising and coordinating, by unanimous decisions, the activities related to the country&#x27;s defence and national security. This is right now in the first stages with no single person being put under indictment.</td>\n",

Yes there will be some unintended consequences but academic life is already very rough if you&#x27;re not tenured.<p>Academia likes to cast itself as a true meritocracy. If you work hard and publish good papers you&#x27;ll do well. In practice it&#x27;s more of a gerontocracy where senior members  can single handedly destroy a young investigators career. (It happened to me and I saw it happen to several people). There is little to no recourse against this.<p>Arguments against unionization from already tenured faculty usually sound like: &quot;If you want to be the best in your field you have to work harder than everyone else. Forming a union won&#x27;t change that fact and may even discourage students from working so hard. This might interfere with their career goals.&quot;<p>However, the power structures in academia are heavily skewed and toxic. Individually graduate students have little recourse when they are wronged. Life in academia is hard. You have to work long days, the chance of success is very low. At every stage the probability of getting that next job is very low.<p>A lot of the field agrees that something needs to change, but no one can agree exactly what needs to change or how to get there.  The people with the power are the tenured professors who &quot;won the lottery&quot; and are out of touch with the problems they are causing. They aren&#x27;t going to be the mechanism of change even though they hold all the power.</td>\n",

It&#x27;s really just simple arbitrage: if the value of Bitcoin goes up, but the electricity cost doesn&#x27;t, then you have essentially 2 different prices for 1 good, which should attract more miners to spend more money on electricity.

If this trend continues the mining power will be so consolidated that a 51% attack will be likely. The Nakamoto coefficient is already at 4, and tending towards 3.<p>- energy usage due to Proof of Work is growing astronomically, and the higher the price of bitcoin, the less incentive there is to use renewable energy.

       "      <td>Current USPTO patent examiner here. The most effective way to eliminate bad patents would be to give examiners more time, say double the time across the board to start. If an examiner can&#x27;t find prior art in the little time they&#x27;re given, and they have no other reasons to reject the application, they&#x27;ll have to grant it. The amount of time was (basically) set in the 1970s based on data from the 1960s. There have been some minor increases since then. Several orders of magnitude more prior art exists now. And while search technology has improved, it hasn&#x27;t become orders of magnitude better. So I&#x27;d argue that the workload has increased dramatically since the 1970s. Simply giving examiners more time would probably greatly reduce the grant rate, and also incidentally reduce examiner stress levels. Patent examination is a tough job, as examiners rarely get enough time to do a quality job, and this leads to the high stress levels.<p>USPTO upper management is taking comments about the &quot;robustness and reliability of patent rights&quot; until February. You can leave your comments here:<p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.regulations.gov&#x2F;document&#x2F;PTO-P-2022-0025-0001\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.regulations.gov&#x2F;document&#x2F;PTO-P-2022-0025-0001</a><p>Unfortunately giving examiners more time is only briefly addressed in this request for comments. I think the public should really drive home the point that the procedural changes discussed wouldn&#x27;t be anywhere near as effective as simply giving examiners more time.<p>Don&#x27;t believe examiners are overworked?

Maybe you are but if not, just imagine, tech city on the east or west coast. You&#x27;re pretty invested in being an American, skin in the game, manifest destiny etc. Very good. They call this <i>tianxia</i> by the way, basically Chinese manifest destiny.<p>Let&#x27;s say one day some stupid little state that you don&#x27;t care about and vaguely resent decides it wants to secede, wants all these rights others don&#x27;t have, wants to be able to marry its cousins or make nukes at home or whatever. Alabama, say. Alabama wants to secede and they have some demonstrations. You think: &quot;hahahaha no&quot;<p>They keep demonstrating. The larger country talks about sending in the national guard or something. &quot;Good, who do they think they are&quot; you say.<p>Some alabamans post an app on the app store so they can avoid the national guard. It&#x27;s linked to secessionist alabamans avoiding and even attacking the guard. Apple takes it down, then puts it back up, then takes it back down<p>&quot;Good&quot; you say.<p>This is how, conservatively, 90%+ of Chinese think. For them, HK is a tiny little past-glory city who thinks it&#x27;s better than everyone else and is just causing trouble. They will eventually be brought into line, hopefully without too much bloodshed, just like Alabama. It&#x27;s not really malicious. It&#x27;s a province of China - it&#x27;s misbehaving, and it will be brought into line in due course. Nothing more, nothing less.<p>I expect someone explained these truths to Apple, they saw the futility of taking some hopeless, simplistic, you-don&#x27;t-even-live-here side, decided this was not the hill they wanted to die on, and pulled the app. I don&#x27;t blame them.<p>I&#x27;d like to note that I do not support the Chinese Govt in any way and think the world would be a better place with an independent, democratic HK - a city I genuinely love. The Chinese have about as much chance agreeing with that as Americans would about an independent Alabama. Not going to happen.</td>\n",

They build a platform, and users contribute their time, thought, energy, and knowledge to build a community on that platform. Those companies can then gatekeep and restrict access to all that the community built, when all they did is provide the platform, and store the data. We need to rethink this model.<p>The thought and knowledge of communities and users need to belong to those communities and users. To people they intentionally and thoughtfully delegate to and trust. We need to decentralize our communications, like how the internet used to be before the arrival of social media and mega forums. We need to revert to small, focused forums, with less anonymous, more persistent communication, run by people we trust. Otherwise, we will continue to see mega companies harvest our data and use it (or not provide it) against our wishes. If we don’t work to mitigate that dynamic, we have nobody to blame for the poor outcomes but ourselves.</td>\n",

Let's assume the global economy grows at 4% per year. Do Bitcoin's proponents believe a constant 4% deflation rate will be somehow compatible with capitalism? Why lend, why build new companies, when simply storing it is more than enough? Take shocks such as bubbles and demand-side crises. Could a economy based on Bitcoin survive them, and not crash inevitably into a deflationary spiral? I claim it won't.<p>The party line usually argues for the evils of inflation. What they don't understand, I think, is that capitalism, in its revolutionary (in the sense of production) facet, <i>needs</i> inflation, <i>feeds</i> from it. Inflation might screw lenders, and favor debtors, sure. But deflation is just the inverse: a gift for the leecherous rentier class, and a massive \"fuck you\" to entrepreneurs.</td>\n",

I&#x27;m designing it for self-hosting, and it&#x27;s a radically different way of working to what I&#x27;m used to (operating services just for my company).

I am not on the platform team, but I have built apps before in the wild-west days.<p>The app requires explicit permission from the user in order to post activities automatically. The idea, if you watched Mark's presentation, is called \"frictionless sharing.\" A lot of people don't share because it's another step, but if they could install an app like the Washington Post Reader (a great app--even Mark has it installed), they are happy with sharing articles they've read with their friends.<p>I understand you might be concerned, for example if you added that app without realizing that it will post content. If you are concerned about the privacy implications, you can always change individual permissions for an app by going to your account settings, then selecting the 'app' tab on the left, or by going to <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/settings?tab=applications\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://www.facebook.com/settings?tab=applications</a>. If you are concerned about spamming your friends' news feeds, that's why we built ticker, for the light-weight activities like \"watched a movie\" or \"listened to a song\" or \"read an article\".<p>If I remember correctly, the exact wording of the app permission request was alarming enough to get my full attention (\"I, the application, can post as you\" or something like that), so I'm worried less about a user missing that part. In my known experiences, the app was installed with the knowledge that it will share your experiences--because the idea is you want to share your activities with your friends. As soon as I read an article, my first action is to either send the link to specific people who are interested, or post it on my wall if I think everyone is interested.<p>We operate under the assumption that users will not do what they don't want to do, as long as we make it explicit what might happen. And if they make a mistake, they can always go change their settings. So I'm not so worried about users who sign up for the Washington Post Reader app, which is marketed as a social reading experiment, and subsequently complain that it shares your read articles.<p>You might still be concerned, in which case, please let me know why (users being misinformed?), and I'll try to pass it onto the platform folks, who were really heads-down the past few months.</td>\n",

Once it&#x27;s done, it gets archived. I star the stuff that I&#x27;ll need to refer to later, like tickets for a flight or concert. I then have a few server side rules to do things like mark certain classes of emails as read (eg build logs, mailing lists), so as to not flood my phone with notifications. And... that&#x27;s it.<p>(edit: oh and yes, I am also very diligent about unsubscribing from the stuff I know will never be relevant, rather than just archiving it and forgetting about it until another email from the same source comes up a week later.

There are legitimate concerns about health privacy (especially for women in the US) but the upside is just so much larger than the harms.

Seeing the incredible results of stable diffusion, we were curious if we could fine tune the model to output spectrograms and then convert to audio clips. The answer to that was a resounding yes, and we became addicted to generating music from text prompts. There are existing works for generating audio or MIDI from text, but none as simple or general as fine tuning the image-based model. Taking it a step further, we made an interactive experience for generating looping audio from text prompts in real time. To do this we built a web app where you type in prompts like a jukebox, and audio clips are generated on the fly. To make the audio loop and transition smoothly, we implemented a pipeline that does img2img conditioning combined with latent space interpolation.</td>\n",

My parents always told me that one should take Sudafed when flying after having had a cold, in order to avoid severe ear pain from the pressure changes, but people would also obviously take it when not flying, just in order to reduce the discomfort of the congestion itself.<p>Pseudoephedrine is very effective. It is also used to synthesize the somewhat related illegal drug methamphetamine (&quot;meth&quot;). Historically, meth manufacturers would hire people to buy large amounts of pseudoephedrine pills at pharmacies and supermarkets, then grind them up and synthesize meth from them.<p>In order to deter this, authorities in the U.S. restricted the availability of pseudoephedrine, while not making it prescription-only, by limiting the amount that people could buy, and requiring buyers to show ID and be put on a registry (which law enforcement could use in investigations). I think this is the only drug that is treated this way. Some people stopped buying pseudoephedrine entirely, either because they were offended by these rules or because they were afraid that they could wrongly be implicated in meth investigations if they appeared to buy it too often.<p>The pharmaceutical industry produced an alternative called phenylephrine, the substance that this proceeding relates to. Most manufacturers of pseudoephedrine-based drugs, including Sudafed, formulated alternative decongestants using phenylephrine. There are no legal restrictions on phenylephrine drugs; one can buy them anonymously and in any quantity. Customers have complained for years that these are much less effective than the original formulations.<p>A couple of years ago this regulatory authority started looking into the question of whether phenylephrine is actually <i>completely useless</i> as a decongestant (rather than just much worse than pseudoephedrine). Their preliminary review of studies suggested that it is probably, in fact, useless. This proceeding is now proposing to ban it on the grounds that it&#x27;s ineffective and so people should not be encouraged to buy and use it as a medicine for purposes for which it doesn&#x27;t actually work.<p>(There doesn&#x27;t seem to be much corresponding initiative to remove or reduce the restrictions on pseudoephedrine.)</td>\n",

Perhaps it gets at the same thing as the author from a different angle.<p>I think the reason, plain and simple, is that most developers aren&#x27;t really in it for the passion anymore, but rather the money.<p>When I first started coding, I didn&#x27;t get paid. I didn&#x27;t think I ever would. I was just having fun building stuff for myself. I, and the other people like that, moved into the workforce and brought that level of curiosity. Of hacker spirit.<p>However, as the idea of &quot;programming makes money&quot; became more well known, and bootcamps + college both upped their game, more and more people started coding just with the hopes to make money. To get good enough to make money, not care about &quot;huh, how does the bootloader actually work&quot; or &quot;Why did chrome just crash, let me open up gdb...&quot;.<p>At the same time, I think other people who came into tech when it was a less obvious career path (and thus was something you usually discovered based on having some initial interest outside of &quot;I want a paycheck&quot;) are getting older. They&#x27;re getting older, having kids, and now also have a reason to treat their job as a 9-5. &quot;Chrome crashed, I could open gdb and figure it out... but I&#x27;d rather watch my kid&#x27;s soccer game&quot;.<p>I think new hackers still form, but they&#x27;re diluted by programming becoming a career path desired for money, not just for a love of programming itself.

There should already be a not-so-huge wave of accomplishment coming from all these people. Not to belittle them and their abilities, but there isn&#x27;t. Just about everything that we consider a real advance comes from people working the system that exists using their own ingenuity, not from people allowed to escape the system by providing them an inalienable source of income.<p>Modern Western societies are rich enough that smart, motivated individuals can mostly rise to the level of their own ability.

If it is, what if you amped this up and had very fine-grained physical location changes. Alternatively does it actually need to be a different location?

Whenever I sit down to write some code, be it a large implementation or a small function, I think about what other people (or future versions of myself) will struggle with when interacting with the code. Is it clear and concise? Is it too clever? Is it too easy to write a subtle bug when making changes? Have I made it totally clear that X is relying on Y dangerous behavior by adding a comment or intentionally making it visible in some other way?<p>It goes the other way too. If I know someone well (or their style) then it makes evaluating their code easier. The more time I spend in a codebase the better idea I have of what the writer was trying to do. I remember spending a lot of time reading the early Redis codebase and got a pretty good sense of how Salvatore thinks. Or altering my approaches to code reviews depending on which coworker was submitting it. These weren&#x27;t things I were doing out of desire but because all non-trivial code has so much subtlety; it&#x27;s just the nature of the beast.<p>So the thought of opening up a codebase that was cobbled together by an AI is just scary to me. Subtle bugs and errors would be equally distributed across the whole thing instead of where the writer was less competent (as is often the case).

Adding a synthetic key only means you have to track all three.

What <i>identifies</i> it. Sometimes, it makes you go back to the SME and ask them what they mean. Sometimes it makes you reconsider time: it’s unique now, but does it change over time, and does the database need to capture that?  In short, what are the boundaries of the Closed World Assumption?

Better question: how will the surrogate key protect you? It will not. The reused ID will be used to query the system. Without some distinguishing feature, perhaps date, it will serve up duplicates.

Corporations pursue growth because investors demand it.<p>3. Investors demand growth because they want a certain minimum return on investment.<p>4. Investors need to invest money in instruments with a certain minimum ROI because if they don&#x27;t, inflation will erode their savings.<p>5. This continuous growth requirement forces companies to compete for larger and larger portions of market share, which in turn forces their competitors to compete harder in response.<p>6. The end result is a sort of &quot;Red Queen&quot; effect where everyone is forced to compete harder and harder just to maintain his&#x2F;her existing standard of living.<p>7. We know that the more extreme a competition becomes, the more ruthless the participants become, often to the point of acting immorally.<p>8.

VR and cyrpto provide value too, it&#x27;s just that the markets for that tech are way more &quot;niche&quot; than companies were hoping for.<p>And I don&#x27;t think VR is going away. If it wasn&#x27;t dead in the water in the 90s, then it&#x27;s not going to die because the Metaverse failed. But its applicability is currently limited to a few niche applications like video games and possibly CAD type software.<p>The thing that generative AI has going for it is that it is extremely broad in so far as its applicability. In other words, good luck selling my next door neighbour on generative AI. What is it? What is it good for? What problems does it solve in the here and now?<p>Generative AI is like electricity, only I don&#x27;t think quite as useful. The point is that, on its own, it has no value what-so-ever. The value lies in what it is used for.<p>Right now what I am observing is a phenomenon that is way too common in our industry. Companies are rushing to go to market with some AI &quot;thing.&quot; 99.9999% of those &quot;things&quot; will end up being more versions of the Metaverse and crypto. Because most of these companies aren&#x27;t really sure what problem they are solving for actual people. It&#x27;s all so novel and abstract and people are seeing dollar signs with very little understanding of how they are going to put it to use.<p>Where it finds its uses, I predict will be limited to the same applications that we&#x27;re already using ML for. Chat bots, entertainment, generating document outlines etc. Just because we made a big breakthrough with the technology doesn&#x27;t mean that we&#x27;ve actually created a solution to real world problems that real world people are having here and now in the real world. No one, other than maybe Open AI, is going to get rich on &quot;generative AI.&quot; If they get rich and change the industry, it will be finding a use for it that many people want.</td>\n",

Bitfinex produces it, though they&#x27;re cagey (some would say outright lying at times) about the level of involvement.<p>The primary purpose of tethers is money laundering, even more so than cryptocurrency generally. Bitfinex was cut off from the US financial system, which makes it impossible for them to clear USD-denominated wires. Their clients have ~$400M of USD on deposit with Bitfinex. Their solution: issue a cryptocurrency which is claimed to be 100% backed by USD and say that it is redeemable 1-to-1 for dollars... we just can&#x27;t actually physically give you the dollars.<p>Incredibly, this has worked so far. Bitfinex has issued approximately $600 million in tethers, all but $10 million or so in the last 6 months. They&#x27;re usable on a handful of exchanges, for the purpose of buying BTC and other cryptocurrencies.<p>Tether claims that someone has stolen 5% or so of their $600 million tethers -- the digital claims, not the underlying dollars sitting at their totally-exists-we-promise bank account. They&#x27;ve made a technological change to the Omni client to disallow transactions on the stolen tokens, but there is no guarantee that they succeed in convincing all parties to use this.<p>The nightmare scenario for them is 1+ exchanges say &quot;Well, actually, we rely on your money actually being money to list it here, so pick: we delist you or we don&#x27;t, but we don&#x27;t have any incentive to apply that patch.&quot; [0] The thief immediately exfiltrates to Bitcoin, and suddenly 30 million hot tethers are contaminating the money stream at the exchange, and they cannot be conveniently disambiguated from clean tethers, because money is fungible.<p>Hilarity then ensues, for values of hilarity which probably mean &quot;bank run&quot; on a bank which is structurally incapable of paying out most holders of money.<p>[0] Why does Bitfinex care whether their cryptocurrency is listed at other exchanges? Because they need to launder money to support their exchange business. Tethers are institutionalizing a sort of crypto-hawala (or crypto-Liberty Reserve), allowing the physical transfer of real money to happen at legal remoteness to the cryptocurrency exchange.<p>Bitfinex has an order book filled with something people want. A way to get access to that orderbook is to say &quot;Bitfinex, I want some tether, how do you sell them to me if you can&#x27;t accept a wire?&quot; Bitfinex might say &quot;Are you a trustworthy US VC? Spiffy. Move $20 million from your left hand pocket to your right hand pocket. The right hand pocket is now ours; here&#x27;s $20 to $21 million in Tether, which are good for BTC at your favorite exchanges. At some time in the future, a trustworthy US VC other than yourself is going to ask you to buy some tether from them at par value. You will do that, and pay them from your right pocket. If a regulator asks you about this transaction, you bat your eyes and say &#x27;Oh, sophisticated investors doing a cryptocurrency transaction, nothing to see here.&#x27;&quot;<p>Post-script: Is this good news for Bitcoin? Oh this is <i>great</i> news for Bitcoin. If you don&#x27;t believe Bitfinex&#x27;s $600 million in liabilities are worth a copper shilling, the only option for getting your value out of Bitfinex is to swap your liability for Bitcoin, which drives up the price of Bitcoin at the margin.<p>This is exactly what happened in the final months of Mt. Gox.</td>\n",

You&#x27;re supposed to stop sending emails to someone who&#x27;s not interacting with them, or you get an extra point towards being flagged as spam. Since people are already weary of clicking the unsubscribe link and instead casually mark everything as spam, every little bit towards keeping your reputation counts. It&#x27;s a damned if you do, damned if you don&#x27;t situation.<p>This is the reason why I had to implement a tracking pixel on <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;hndigest.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;hndigest.com</a><p>Tangentially related anecdote: I also had to implement redirects instead of direct linking to the stories: At one point a URL with the .tk TLD was at the top of HN, and as soon as I sent out the first email with that story in it, my email sending service immediately flagged my account as a spammer and blocked all my sending, because the .tk domain was such a red flag. Since then I redirect all stories through my own domain, to avoid any other TLD red-flags from crippling the service.<p>It&#x27;s difficult running a legit DIY newsletter, every party involved is super suspicious and one wrong move or mistake can end it all.<p>Edit: A lot of people are wondering about why I think people press the spam button instead of unsubscribe, so let me elaborate a little more. HNDigest uses double opt-in (you receive a confirmation email which you need to click on before you&#x27;re subscribed), listens to all feedback loops, has an instant unsubscribe button. We never spam or send emails that weren&#x27;t requested by the user. By all accounts, it&#x27;s a legit newsletter and I try to be as above board as possible.<p>Yet 30% of all unsubscribes happen because someone has marked the email as spam. I know this because this generates a notification on the feedback loop, and then I immediately stop sending of course. These are the facts. So, assuming HNdigest is not actually spamming (which is something I do believe), 1 out of 3 people click the spam button either by accident, or to unsubscribe.</td>\n",

And that&#x27;s off an 8.5 hour day. It&#x27;s at the point now where it&#x27;s extremely likely I&#x27;ll leave software for good.<p>Software to me is extremely mentally demanding and draining, it requires short burts of extreme concentration, but what is more draining is making up the remaining 4-5 hours looking busy. My experience of software work is that it doesn&#x27;t scale linearly with number of hours. Unless you reach flow which is extremely rare in a business setting (thanks open-office &#x2F; scrum) you can get the work done very quickly and then have large periods of unproductive time.<p>It&#x27;s my experience that at most 2-3 hours is productively spent, the rest is wasted.<p>I meet software developers who advocate for, or don&#x27;t mind, 8, 9, 10 hour days and I simply don&#x27;t understand it, it&#x27;s alien to me. Are they being productive all that time?<p>Edit: to clarify (since I&#x27;ve posted on this topic elsewhere today) the 8.5 hours include a 1 hour lunch break and Fridays are slightly shorter.</td>\n",

       "      <td>&gt; But I remember the times when we had the amazing Opera browser. In Opera, I could have a hundred open tabs, and it didn’t care, it worked incredibly fast on the hardware of its era, useless today. You may ask: why would a sane person want a hundred open tabs, how would you even manage that? Well, Opera has had a great UI for that, which nobody has ever matched. Working with a hundred tabs in Opera was much easier back then than working with ten in today’s Safari or Chrome. But that’s a whole different story. What would you do today if you opened a link and saw a long article which you don’t have time to read right now, but want to read later? You would save a link and close the tab. But when your browser is fast, you just don’t tend to close tabs which you haven’t dealt with. In Opera, I would let tabs stay open for months without having any impact on my machine’s performance.<p>This is exactly how I&#x27;m using Firefox, right now -- 273 tabs open. It&#x27;s sitting at ~5% of CPU and 450MB of RAM. And switching tabs is instantaneous. And it doesn&#x27;t reload every page when I quit and restart my browser -- it only loads a tab when I click into that tab. And it has tab groups so that my current group has only about 8 tabs in it, and the other groups are sorted by topic. And on and on.<p>I find it frustrating when people post these articles as if everyone has this problem, and don&#x27;t provide enough details as to their setup so that people can help them fix it. I promise you -- if everyone around the world right now had the problem the author was having, it would have been solved. No one would stand for it. Rather than assume everyone is suffering just like you, assume that other people either a) don&#x27;t behave the way you do, or b) have found a way to fix the problem.</td>\n",

The other is the Apple branded credit card issued by Goldman Sachs.<p>Leaving aside the branded credit card, the Apple Pay process is a standard that Apple worked with Visa&#x2F;MC (and Google and Samsung) to develop. Essentially, a customer of a bank enrolls their card into Apple&#x2F;Google&#x2F;Samsung Pay and there is a tokenization service that provisions the phone Secure Element with an EMV &quot;application&quot; and the tokenized card.<p>The card has a <i>different</i> number to the actual issued card, maintaining the first 6 (issuer ID) and last 4 digits of the issued card (CPAN - Customer Primary Account Number) to establish a &quot;DPAN&quot;.<p>When the phone is tapped, as far as the reader is concerned, it is a standard EMV card. The reader will go through its standard business rules for floor limits, PINs etc and process the transaction.<p>The merchant only gets the &quot;6+4&quot; digits of the card, the DPAN is sent over the network to the tokenization service, which translates the DPAN to the CPAN and sends the transaction to the issuing bank for authentication and payment.<p>The lack of being able to get the &quot;real&quot; CPAN is why some US merchants still refuse Apple&#x2F;Google&#x2F;Samsung Pay, specifically because they lose the ability to track customers.<p>The problem in the US, is instead of going to &quot;Chip + PIN&quot; like the rest of the world, the US went to &quot;Chip + Signature&quot; which removes the benefits of Chip+PIN in terms of fraud reduction etc.</td>\n",

Specifically I have troubles embracing the need to mark function as &quot;async&quot; – it just doesn&#x27;t make sense to me. Synchronous or asynchronous is something up to the caller to the decide – not to the function itself.<p>Like in real life I can do something synchronously (meaning paying full attention), or I can do the same task asynchronously (watching youtube videos in the background while cooking, for example), but it&#x27;s still up to me. Being &quot;async&quot; is not a property of the &quot;watching youtube&quot; action, it&#x27;s the property of the caller running this action.<p>That&#x27;s the reason why CSP-based concurrency models really works well for me – it&#x27;s just so easy to map mental models of system&#x27;s behaviour from the head directly to the code. You have function&#x2F;process and it&#x27;s up to you how do you run it and&#x2F;or how synchronize with it later.<p>Async&#x2F;await concept so popular in modern languages is totally nuts in this aspect. Maybe it&#x27;s just me, but I find myself adding more accidental complexity to the code just to make async&#x2F;await functions work nicely, especially for simple cases where I don&#x27;t need concurrency at all, but one &quot;async&quot; function creeps in.</td>\n",

So I hope people will entertain a contrarian question without downvoting me into oblivion. :)<p>Here&#x27;s the thing I keep circling around: assume that bad actors, government or otherwise, want to target political dissidents using internet-enabled smartphones. The more we learn about the way Apple actually implemented this technology, the less likely it seems that it would make it radically easier for those bad actors to do so. For instance, the &quot;it only scans photos uploaded to iCloud&quot; element isn&#x27;t just an arbitrary limitation that can be flipped with one line of code, as some folks seem to think; as Erik Neuenschwander, head of Privacy Engineering at Apple, explained in an interview on TechCrunch[1]:<p>&gt; Our system involves both an on-device component where the voucher is created, but nothing is learned, and a server-side component, which is where that voucher is sent along with data coming to Apple service and processed across the account to learn if there are collections of illegal CSAM. That means that it is a service feature.<p>Will this stop those bad actors if they&#x27;re determined? No, of course not, but there are <i>so many ways</i> they can do it already. They&#x27;ll get cloud storage providers to give them access. If they can&#x27;t, they&#x27;ll get <i>network</i> providers to give them access. And if those bad actors are, as many people fear, government actors, then they have tools far more potent than code: they have laws. It was illegal to export &quot;strong encryption&quot; for many years, remember? I&#x27;ve seen multiple reports that European lawmakers are planning to require some kind of scanning for CSAM. If this goes into effect, technology isn&#x27;t going to block those laws for you. Your Purism phone will either be forced to comply or be illegal.<p>I wrote in a previous comment on this that one of Silicon Valley&#x27;s original sins is that we tend to treat all problems as if they&#x27;re engineering problems. Apple is treating CSAM as an engineering problem. Most of the discussion on HN about how horrible and wrong Apple is here <i>still</i> treats it as an engineering problem, though: well, you can get around this by just turning off iCloud Photos or never using Apple software or throwing your iPhone in the nearest lake and switching to Android, but only the <i>right</i> kind of Android, or maybe just never doing anything with computers again, which admittedly will probably be effective.<p>Yet at the end of the day, this <i>isn&#x27;t</i> an engineering problem. It&#x27;s a policy problem. It&#x27;s a governance problem. In the long run, we solve this, at least in liberal democracies, by voting people into office who understand technology, understand the value of personal encryption, and last but certainly not least, understand the value of, well, liberal democracy. I know that&#x27;s easy to dismiss as Pollyannaism, but &quot;we need to protect ourselves from our own government&quot; has a pretty dismal track record historically. The entire point of having a liberal democracy is that <i>we are the government,</i> and we can pull it back from authoritarianism.<p>The one thing that Apple is absolutely right about is that expanding what those hashes check for is a policy decision. Maybe where those hashes get checked isn&#x27;t really what we need to be arguing about.<p>[1]: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;techcrunch.com&#x2F;2021&#x2F;08&#x2F;10&#x2F;interview-apples-head-of-privacy-details-child-abuse-detection-and-messages-safety-features&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;techcrunch.com&#x2F;2021&#x2F;08&#x2F;10&#x2F;interview-apples-head-of-p...</a></td>\n",

       "      <td>I am an Asian-American high school senior who is nearing the end of the college admissions process.<p>I am so frustrated and angry that there is this discrimination, and people defend it. I feel that people don&#x27;t take racism against Asian-Americans as seriously as racism against other groups.<p>Here&#x27;s more about me. Like many people on HN, I&#x27;m a programmer. I&#x27;m interested in functional programming, programming language theory, and type theory. These interests caused me to discover pure math (such as category theory), and although I do not know as much about math than about programming, I want to learn more because I find these ideas elegant and beautiful. (For example, the Curry-Howard correspondence, which links programming to logic through the idea that programs are proofs, or HoTT, which gives types higher-dimensional structure based on the idea that equality types are the isomorphisms of an infinity-groupoid.)<p>I applied as a CS major to several colleges where PL theory had an academic presence, and in my supplemental essays, I discussed my interests and my desire to work with professors and do undergraduate research. I have competitive stats. Although other kids in my school got into my &quot;reaches&quot; (e.g. Cornell), I got rejected, but luckily I got into some &quot;match&quot; schools that did PL theory.<p>It&#x27;s hard to say if affirmative action made a difference. Maybe if my application were exactly the same, but I weren&#x27;t Asian, I would have gotten in, and if my application were the same except that I got an A instead of a B+ in a class, I would also have gotten in. I got waitlisted from some highly competitive schools, so I could have been on the edge. A big part of me not knowing how much my race would have made a difference is how non-transparent college admissions are. It&#x27;s left up to some nebulous idea of &quot;fit&quot; decided by a group of people sitting at a table, who only have a few minutes to spend on each applicant.<p>But, what bothers me is the stereotypes. They&#x27;ve turned liking math and CS into a bad thing, at least when it&#x27;s an Asian kid who&#x27;s doing it. People defend affirmative action by saying that there are simply too many highly competitive Asian kids who want to study computer science. So, if I want to go to a good school, I shouldn&#x27;t study computer science, even though that&#x27;s what I want to do, just because of the way I was born? Among non-CS people, CS is probably seen as the stereotype track to get a high-paying job (and cynically, perhaps it&#x27;s a popular major for this reason), but hopefully on a site such as HN, people will be more empathetic to the appeal of CS.<p>I&#x27;m also frustrated because most people probably don&#x27;t know how math really is like. People just see it as nerdy word problems, and they&#x27;ve never heard of ideas like constructive math, programs-as-proofs, Cartesian closed categories, etc that I&#x27;ve become so intimate with. Why is it bad that I love math? Shouldn&#x27;t you encourage me to learn this? I guess it&#x27;s similar to the old stereotype of the &quot;nerd&quot; with no social skills, except with a racial element now.<p>It&#x27;s a Catch-22 because people hold Asians to a higher standard, so we need to get higher grades and test scores to be competitive, then that feeds back into the stereotype that we are overly studious and have no personality. There is no winning for us in this game. Isn&#x27;t it an objectively good thing to do well in school? If it were someone who weren&#x27;t Asian, people would see high scores and grades as a positive thing or even cheer it on as a sign of increasing equality. Like all competitive high schoolers (of all races), we must play the game of having loads of AP classes, etc, but people specifically see Asians doing this as a negative stereotype.<p>But, on the front of us studying too much and not having personality, if you play an instrument, people will assume that you&#x27;re doing it because your parents made you, or because of college admissions. Music is truly a beautiful thing and I experienced just how heartfelt it can be. (Sidenote: Watch Hibike! Euphonium or Your Lie in April!) But, just like the universal language of math, people have somehow turned Asians practicing the universal language of music into a bad thing. I can&#x27;t imagine stronger proof of not being a robot, of being human, than experiencing how music can move you.<p>I implore you, in the meritocratic tradition of the hacker culture, to speak out against affirmative action and support Asian kids who want to pursue these passions.<p>EDIT: In fact, &quot;affirmative action&quot; is a euphemism. It&#x27;s a vague-sounding term (an action that affirms something?) because people don&#x27;t want to say &quot;racial discrimination.&quot; Words have power to influence people, so I should start calling it what it is.</td>\n",

Maybe.<p>In reality, your compensation is a function of your negotiating power. Some people, in fact, manage to get the same pay even when working remote, because they&#x27;re &quot;highly employable&quot;. Others don&#x27;t.<p>And let me add: I almost agree that remote work shouldn&#x27;t necessarily command the same pay. A company&#x27;s goal is to &quot;extract&quot; from each employee more value than his&#x2F;her&#x2F;their salary. If a company manages to save on a salary because the employee doesn&#x27;t have much negotiating power, good for the company.<p>This is not to say that a company should do anything it wants, far from it. It simply means that if you accept that you live in a market-enabled society, your salary is at stake, too. You want to pay $2 dollars for milk, instead of $20? That&#x27;s thanks to competition between companies. That&#x27;s market forces at play. You want it there? Accept it on salary negotiation too.</td>\n",

(This is of course true of all decisions.)<p>I would like to contribute a bit of information.<p>I&#x27;m 66, and have three children and four grandchildren.  My adult children are the most wonderful people I know, and it is comforting to be aware that we will be part of each others&#x27; lives forever.  I spent a lot of time in assisted living facilities with my mother as her health failed, and I saw a lot of old people in those facilities with no one to visit them.  It is comforting to know that I will not spend my final years in loneliness and isolation.<p>Our grandchildren are an unalloyed joy.  We have two 3-year-old identical twin grand-daughters, and they are working their way through the nuances and finer points of grammar.  It is indescribably adorable to see their efforts at expressing their detailed and elaborate thoughts.  My grandsons are seriously into aviation, and I&#x27;ve become the go-to aerodynamics consultant.  Our four-year-old asked me with great seriousness, &quot;Grand-dad, why is the horizontal stabilizer always shorter than the wings?&quot;  Another time, the family was at the beach.  He, his dad, and I were looking out at the ocean.  He asked, &quot;What are waves?&quot;  Darn good questions!<p>No rose-colored glasses fantasy here:  I&#x27;ve found that your children can break your heart and devastate you just as well as bring you unfathomable joy.  My daughter (a black-belt IP lawyer now), when she was about four, wandered off in a crowded video game arcade, and we searched through the crowds for her for about ten minutes, with growing panic and horror.  We found her and all was fine.  Fact is, if you love someone as much as you end up loving your children and grandchildren, their decisions and choices will have profound effects on you.  My therapist observes that you are only as happy as your least happy child.<p>So, the decision about whether to start trying to have a family is a BIG-ASS decision, with life-long consequences.  I highly recommend it.</td>\n",

But if you dig into how they got rich, the old days don&#x27;t look so good. In 1982, 84% of the richest 100 people got rich by inheritance, extracting natural resources, or doing real estate deals. Is that really better than a world in which the richest people get rich by starting tech companies?</i>&quot;<p>And my answer to that question would be, arguably yes. Why? Because at least old money understands the concept of <i>noblesse oblige</i>. The real sinister psychological thing going on behind the Graham argument is that it&#x27;s not at all about meritocracy, it&#x27;s that this mentality of earned wealth completely rids the owner of any sort of responsibility.<p>The aristocrats and oligarchs of the olden days might have been corrupt, debauched and half-useless, but at least they knew it. This new, self-made entrepreneur class does not only think they have earned their money themselves, which as a sidenote is also kind of a fiction, but that they&#x27;re intellectually superior, morally superior and virtuous in ways that anyone else just can&#x27;t understand.<p>Old money might have ignored you and thrown a party, but Silicon Valley money wants to remake people in their images, they have a Protestant zealotry associated with their money that makes any oligarch look straight up sympathetic in comparison.<p>C.S Lewis:<p><i>&quot;“Of all tyrannies, a tyranny sincerely exercised for the good of its victims may be the most oppressive. It would be better to live under robber barons than under omnipotent moral busybodies. The robber baron&#x27;s cruelty may sometimes sleep, his cupidity may at some point be satiated; but those who torment us for our own good will torment us without end for they do so with the approval of their own conscience. They may be more likely to go to Heaven yet at the same time likelier to make a Hell of earth. This very kindness stings with intolerable insult. To be &quot;cured&quot; against one&#x27;s will and cured of states which we may not regard as disease is to be put on a level of those who have not yet reached the age of reason or those who never will; to be classed with infants, imbeciles, and domestic animals.”</i></td>\n",

I thought bypassing The Great Firewall was going to be as simple as an &quot;ssh -D&quot; SOCKS setup, or a &quot;ssh -w&quot; tunnel. Oh boy, I was wrong. If you try this, or even a basic OpenVPN setup, you will quickly find out your VPN works fine for about 5 minutes, but then latency increases to 5sec, 10sec, 30sec(!), and then everything times out. After some research I read online the government does deep packet analysis and uses machine learning to find heuristics to guess which TCP connection or UDP stream is likely being used as a VPN. When they think there is a high probability a VPN is detected, they simply start dropping all the packets.<p>Encryption is not enough. You need to disguise your VPN traffic to make it look like standard HTTPS sessions (since they don&#x27;t block HTTPS). For example in a traditional HTTPS session, if the client browser downloads, say, a 500kB image over HTTPS, it will send periodical empty TCP ACK packets as it receives the data. But when using a VPN that encrypts data at the IP layer, these empty ACK packets will be encrypted, so The Great Firewall will see the client sending small ~80-120 bytes encrypted packets, and will count this as one more sign that this might be a VPN.<p>That&#x27;s why people in China have to use VPN tools that most westerners have never heard of: obfsproxy, ShadowVPN, SoftEther, gohop, etc. All these tools try to obfuscate and hide VPNs. I have a lot of respect for all these Chinese hackers like clowwindy who try to escape censorship, as it takes more technical prowess than you think to design a VPN that works in China.</td>\n",

Here&#x27;s a demo video.[1]\\nIt&#x27;s about 40,000 lines of Rust so far.<p>If you are doing a non-crappy metaverse, which is rare, you need to wrangle a rather excessive amount of data in near real time. In games, there&#x27;s heavy optimization during game development to prevent overloading the play engine. In a metaverse, as with a web browser, you have to take what the users create and deal with it. You need 2x-3x the VRAM a comparable game would need, a few hundred megabits per second of network bandwidth to load all the assets from servers, a half dozen or so CPUs running flat out, and Vulkan to let you put data into the GPU from one thread while another thread is rendering.<p>So there will be some parallelism involved.<p>This is not like &quot;web-scale&quot; concurrency, which is typically a large number of mini-servers, each doing their own thing, that just happen to run in the same address space. This is different. There&#x27;s a high priority render thread drawing the graphics. There&#x27;s a update thread processing incoming events from the network. There are several asset loading and decompression threads, which use up more CPU time than I&#x27;d like. There are about a half dozen other threads doing various miscellaneous tasks - handling moving objects, updating levels of detail, purging caches, and such.<p>There&#x27;s considerable locking, but no &quot;static&quot; data other than constants. No globals. \\nChannels are used where appropriate to the problem. The main object tree is single ownership, and used mostly by the update thread. Its links to graphics objects are Arc reference counted, and those are updated by both the update thread and the asset loading threads. They in turn use reference counted handles into the Rend3 library, which, via WGPU and Vulkan, puts graphics content (meshes and textures) into the GPU. Rendering is a loop which just tells Rend3 &quot;Go&quot;, over and over.<p>This works out quite well in Rust. If I had to do this in C++, I&#x27;d be fighting crashes all the time.\\nThere&#x27;s a reason most of the highly publicized failed metaverse projects didn&#x27;t reach this level of concurrency.\\nIn Rust, I have about one memory related crash per year, and it&#x27;s <i>always</i> been in someone else&#x27;s &quot;unsafe&quot; code. My own code has no &quot;unsafe&quot;, and I have &quot;unsafe&quot; locked out to prevent it from creeping in. The normal development process is that it&#x27;s hard to get things to compile, and then it Just Works.\\nThat&#x27;s great! I hate using a debugger, especially on concurrent programs. Yes, sometimes you can get stuck for a day, trying to express something within the ownership rules. Beats debugging.<p>I have my complaints about Rust. The main ones are:<p>- Rust is race condition free, but not deadlock free. It needs a static deadlock analyzer, one that tracks through the call chain and finds that lock A is locked before lock B on path X, while lock B is locked before path A on path Y. Deadlocks, though, tend to show up early and are solid problems, while race conditions show up randomly and are hard to diagnose.<p>- Async contamination. Async is all wrong when there&#x27;s considerable compute-bound work, and incompatible with threads running at multiple priorities. It keeps creeping in. I need to contact a crate maintainer\\nand get them to make their unused use of &quot;reqwest&quot; dependent on a feature, so I don&#x27;t pull in Tokio. I&#x27;m not using it, but it&#x27;s there.<p>- Single ownership with a back reference is a very common need, and it&#x27;s too hard to do. I use Rc and Weak for that, but shouldn&#x27;t have to. What&#x27;s needed is a set of traits to manage consistent forward and back links (that&#x27;s been done by others) and static analysis to eliminate the reference counts.\\nThe basic constraints are ordinary borrow checker restrictions - if you have mutable access to either parent or child, you can&#x27;t have access to the other one. But you can have non-mutable access to both.\\nIf I had time, I&#x27;d go work on that.<p>- I&#x27;ve learned to live without objects, but the trait system is somewhat convoluted.\\nThere&#x27;s one area of asset processing that really wants to be object oriented, and I have more duplicate code\\nthere than I like. I could probably rewrite it to use traits more, but it would take some bashing to make\\nit fit the trait paradigm.<p>- The core graphics crates aren&#x27;t finished. There was an article on HN a few days ago about this. &quot;Rust has 5 games and 50 game engines&quot;. That&#x27;s not a language problem, that&#x27;s an ecosystem problem. Not enough people are doing non-toy graphics in Rust. Watch my video linked below.[1] Compared to a modern AAA game title, it&#x27;s not that great. Compared to anything else being done in Rust (see [2]) it&#x27;s near the front.\\nThis indicates a lack of serious game dev in Rust.\\nI&#x27;ve been asked about this by some pro game devs.\\nMy comment is that if you have a schedule to meet, the Rust game ecosystem isn&#x27;t ready.\\nIt&#x27;s probably about five people working for a year from being ready.<p>[1] <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;video.hardlimit.com&#x2F;w&#x2F;tp9mLAQoHaFR32YAVKVDrz\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;video.hardlimit.com&#x2F;w&#x2F;tp9mLAQoHaFR32YAVKVDrz</a><p>[2] <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;gamedev.rs&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;gamedev.rs&#x2F;</a></td>\n",

You want to build up a flock of hens so big that they are eventually producing thousands of eggs per month. Enough to live off for life and retire.<p>You buy your first 100 hens, and they get right to work. You allow those eggs to hatch so more hens can be born, and you also continue to buy hens from the farm supply store. Suddenly your phone rings and it’s Farmer Joe down the road. “The price of hens has just dropped by 50%! You’ve just lost five grand on those hundred hens you bought last summer!”<p>Is this a sensible way to think about it?<p>No, of course not. You’re happy that hens are cheaper, because now you can build your egg business even faster.<p>Stocks are just like hens. They lay eggs called “dividends”, which are real money that can either flow automatically into your checking account, or automatically reinvest itself to buy still more stocks...There’s only one time you care if one of your shares is down: on the day you sell it.&quot;<p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.mrmoneymustache.com&#x2F;2016&#x2F;02&#x2F;29&#x2F;what-to-do-about-this-scary-stock-market&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.mrmoneymustache.com&#x2F;2016&#x2F;02&#x2F;29&#x2F;what-to-do-about-...</a></td>\n",

Radiologists make a lot of money -- and given their jobs are not tied to high CoL regions (as coders jobs are), they make even more on a CoL-adjust basis. Automating these jobs is the equivalent of killing the golden goose.<p>Further, Radiologists standards of practice are driven partly by their board (The American Board of Radiology) and the <i>supply of labor</i> is also controlled by them (The American Board of Radiology) by way of limited residency spots to train new radiologists.<p>So Radiologists (or any medical specialist) can essentially control the supply of labor, and control the standards of best practice, essentially allowing continued high salaries by way of artificial scarcity. <i>WHY ON EARTH WOULD THEY WANT THEIR WORK AUTOMATED AWAY?</i><p>My experience during my startup was lots of radiologists mildly interested in CV&#x2F;ML&#x2F;AI, interested in lots of discussions, interested in paid advisory roles, interested in paid CMO figurehead-positions, but mostly dragging their feet and hindering real progress, presumably because of the threat it posed. Every action item was hindered by a variety of players in the ecosystem.<p>In fact, most of our R&amp;D and testing was done overseas in a more friendly single payer system. I dont see how the US&#x27;s fee-for-service model for Radiology is ever compatible with real progress to drive down costs or drive up volume&#x2F;value.<p>Not surprisingly, we made a decision to mostly move on. You can see Enlitic (a competitor) didnt do well either despite the star-studded executive team. Another competitor (to be unnamed) appears to have shifted from models to just licensing data. Same for IBM&#x2F;Merge.<p>Going back to seismic interpretation -- this cant be compared to Radiology from a follow-the-money perspective because seismic interpretation isnt effectively a cartel.<p>Happy to speak offline if anyone is curious about specific experiences.

I want to present an alternative viewpoint. It&#x27;s not a monopoly issue, it is an anti-competitive issue.<p>In Canada, we have three major cell carriers. None of them has a monopoly, or anything close to it. None of them has even 50% market share.<p>You can have a 10 GB smartphone plan with Rogers for $75. If you don&#x27;t like that, you can switch to Bell&#x27;s 10 GB plan for $75. If you don&#x27;t like Bell, of course you can switch to Telus&#x27;s 10 GB plan for, wait for it, $75.<p>The Big 3 operate smaller brands with fewer bells and whistles and lower costs. You can get a 4 GB cell plan from Koodo (Telus subsidiary) for $50, or from Fido (Rogers subsidiary) for $50, or from Virgin Mobile (Bell subsidiary) for $50.<p>Sometimes one of them has promotional pricing, like $45 instead of $50 for 4GB. The other two offer the same pricing for the same duration. Sometimes one of them increases their prices by $5 a month citing reasons such as infrastructure investments, lower Canadian dollar value, or inflation. The other two increase their prices by the same amount a couple of days later.<p>And none of this is collusion in the legal sense. They don&#x27;t gather in smoke-filled rooms and decide how to screw over their customers. There is not back-channel communication whatsoever. And it is not because the competition is so perfect the prices have been commoditized. In fact, Canada has some of the highest cell plan prices in the world, even adjusting for factors such as population density and GDP.<p>It&#x27;s just that the big companies have decided to stop competing. If you live in, say Alberta or Ontario or BC, you have three options and they are all the same overpriced crap. Cell carriers in Canada are not a monopoly, but you don&#x27;t have to be a monopoly to harm customers with anti-competitive behaviour.

The doctor, in turn, may give in to the patient&#x27;s emotional pleas, since they are, in effect, in a customer service business. This would be an ethical violation. This rule would remove the ethical temptation of doctors<p>Further, it will be nice not to hear about an erection lasting over 4 hours, and not being too old for sex, in front of my 11 year old daughter while watching the news after dinner.<p>From a policy perspective, since the patients are not usually paying for the meds (you and I do), it makes sense to keep demand and prices low, as the doctors assert.<p>As for the free market, we do not have a free market in medicine.

I used to never find time for gaming. Or games would never keep my attention. I would always wander off to the huge list of things I need to be doing to be a good worker, dad, housekeeper, husband.

Part of the application had patients filling out questionnaires online to show answers to the doctors. We were onboarding different parts of a large healthcare system throughout all this (cardio, GI, etc.) and each had questionnaires that required different logic for when and how to display the questions, so the application had a fairly powerful system for driving the conditional logic of when questions do and do not show up.<p>Well one day I am working on a new set of features to help support the new clinic that’s coming online and for whatever reason the question that should by all rights show up, does not. As I am getting deeper into debugging why, I pepper the code with nonsensical and slightly angry debug statements that show up alongside the questions. After solving the problem I happily clean up and commit the fixed code and move onto the next thing.<p>Well, it turns out I didn’t clean up all the debug statements. The statement I left in said I SEE YOU!!! in big red letters if you answered a particular set of questions in a particular way. This was discovered by a patient. Of the psychiatric clinic that just came online. On the questionnaire meant to evaluate paranoia.<p>Since then I have started using things like aaa and 111 as my debug markers.</td>\n",

I just have a couple of comments (disclaimer: I work for Google).<p>I personally detest abstract puzzles like \"why are manhole covers round?\" or (worse) \"How do you move Mount Fuji?\" AFAIK these types of questions are not and have never been used in engineering hiring at Google (sales, etc I know nothing about). WSJ and other sources have made this (AFAIK inaccurate) claim. It's possible individual interviewers do this.<p>My own philosophy is that a <i>simple</i> whiteboard coding problem is an incredibly useful litmus test. I don't mean anything incredibly complicated either. If you can't write a function that gives me a row of Pascall's triangle, that's a problem. Note: I don't expect you to know what Pascall's Triangle is, merely implement it when explained.<p>Some of you may think such a test is a waste of time but I assure you it is not. It's astonishing how many people can't do this (and even more astonishing how many that do make it through resume and even phone screens).<p>The key here is \"simple\". One problem is that interviewers fall into the trap of thinking these problems are too simple and make the problems increasingly harder. Worse, they may get in a situation of asking someone a problem that is either something they know (because they've covered it before) or they don't (where it's not something you can simply nut out). This is a useless indicator in my experience.<p>Just because you can create a function to return a row of Pascal's triangle doesn't mean you're a great programmer but if you can't, it almost certainly means you aren't. It's a negative signal filter, nothing more, but an incredibly quick and useful one.<p>API pop quizzes I'm not a big fan of either, generally speaking, but on the other hand if you've used a language sufficiently long, basic questions about commonly used libraries aren't unreasonable either.<p>Interviewing is a numbers game. Your goal is to come up with a process that balances time spent by the interviewer with finding a suitable candidate. Note that I didn't say accurately assessing each and every candidate. It's sufficient for the employer to simply find one qualified candidate even if you falsely determine someone who is qualified isn't.<p>A certain error rate is to be expected. It reaches a point where the time investment to reduce it outweighs the benefit of higher accuracy.<p>One final note: I detest (both as an interviewer and an interviewee) any kind of \"take home\" test (other comments have mentioned this).<p>As an interviewer, it's extra work to assess, people cheat, good candidates won't bother and so on.<p>As an interviewee, I'm not going to spend hours on you without speaking to someone first to find out how likely it is that you're a good match for me and the likelihood that you believe I'm a good match for you.<p>I would argue that a take home test is significantly more effort than a simple coding problem that doesn't have a significant increase in accuracy.<p>The one exception to this is automated testing where the problems themselves are relatively interesting. Some of the Facebook Puzzles fell into this category (and some don't). People may do those anyway for kicks. But again, there's nothing stopping someone going to Github and copying and pasting someone else's solution so what value is the filter, really?<p>EDIT: clarified my Pascall's Triangle comment. This isn't a trivia problem. I don't expect people to know what it is, merely implement it when explained.</td>\n",

You get significantly more bang for your buck that way as private finance markets have much more money than is available from the government.<p>Advocating for &quot;affordable housing&quot; is really just an excuse to <i>oppose</i> housing as you can always claim that a project isn&#x27;t sufficiently &quot;affordable&quot;.
